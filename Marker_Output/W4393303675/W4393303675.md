### **DEDICATION**

I want to dedicate this thesis to my Mom (Tracy Stanciel), my Dad (Kevin Stanciel), and my little sister Lauren. You've eached helped me immensely throughout this challenging journey, and always had time to listen to my excited rants about new results in my research. I also would like to dedicate this research to my Pop, Louis Redmond Sr., who passed away after his battle with Alzhemiers in the summer of 2021 while I was writing my thesis. I spent many hours that spring and summer sitting with him and my Granny, Mary Redmond, and writing this paper, so it breaks my heart that he won't get to see my finished research. That is why in honor of my Pop, a portion of the pages of this thesis will be printed on colored paper from his printing business.

### **ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**

<span id="page-7-0"></span>I want to acknowledge my friends and family, who without each and everyone of them I would not have completed this academic journey in two years. I specifically want to acknowledge my parents, Tracy and Kevin, my younger sister Lauren, and my Great Aunt Mattye (Nana) for always pushing me and showing an interest in my research. Thank you to my cousins, Crystal, Ashley, Stephanie, and Rachel, for setting the stage and letting me know that I was more than capable of this journey. Finally, I want to acknowledge my Granny and Pop both for always motivating me to do well in my studies and pushing me to be the best I could be and supporting my journey into the museum and historical research fields.

I want to extend a big thank you to my thesis committee and my major professor Dr. Kelly L. Reddy-Best for not only her willingness to work on this historical research with me, but her tenacity in keeping me on track and ensuring I completed this research. I also would like to acknowledge Agatha Huenpenbecker Burnett Assistantship (AHB) mentor and colleague Dr. Gordon for all the valuable lessons she has taught me. But I would like to extend a big thanks to my friends and AHB colleagues, Joshua Simon and Kyra Streck, because I do not think I would have been able to make it through my time at Iowa State without you.

### **ABSTRACT**

<span id="page-8-0"></span>In this study I analyzed how portraits convey negotiations of the power and status of 16th century aristocratic Renaissance wives and mistresses in Italy. Dress and fashion as a means of communicating identity was heightened amongst the upper classes during the European Renaissance in response to the rise of the merchant class. Women of the aristocracy in particular had numerous motivations for subtle forms of identity expression ranging from declaring political affiliations to national allegiances (Muzzarelli, 2009; Rublack, 2011; Rublack, 2016). Declaring national allegiances was a frequent practice by aristocratic women that entered crosscultural political marriages, forcing them to adopt the cultural norms of their husbands' home (Cox-Rearick, 2009). Utilizing content analysis and the historical method, I analyzed period portraiture of influential 16th century women that were Italian born or married. The portraiture study included twenty-one portraits of nine women. Portraiture selection was informed by online accessibility (as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) and credibility, with portraits primarily identified on museum owned databases and government/publicly funded art databases.

The twenty-one portraits of Caterina Sforza, Bianca Maria Sforza, Cecilia Gallerani, Giulia Farnese, Isabella d'Este, Lucrezia Borgia, Margherita Paleologo, Eleonora di Toledo, and Bianca Cappello, concentrated in 16th century Italy convey this period's exceptional reputation for portraiture and the display of status through dress and other forms of consumerism. Eight prominent themes emerged across the twenty-one portraits which reference the use of dress in relation to concepts of conveyed status, personal preferences, religious references and characteristics, and social and political allegiances with their birth families or their husbands' families.

Each of these nine women embodied many of the period expectations of mothers, wives, mistresses, and rulers. However, all of them found ways to communicate their personal identities through dress, in their portraits, during their lifetimes.

### **CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION**

<span id="page-10-0"></span>The European Renaissance represents one of the most culturally, socially, and politically significant periods in world history. From 1300 to 1600, Europe flourished in a period of artistic, scientific, and political growth and expansion (Rublack, 2011). The Renaissance was marked by two significant cultural periods: The Italian Renaissance and the Northern Renaissance. These two periods are distinguishable by their different cultural and political developments (Eire, 2016; Rublack, 2016; Wundram, 2016; Hagen & Hagen, 2018).

The Italian Renaissance (c. 1300-1600) was a cultural period in which visual artists thrived (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). Artists such as Giotto, Michelangelo, Botticelli, Donatello, and Da Vinci gained notoriety across Europe during the Italian Renaissance and became focal points of centuries of Renaissance art history studies (Paoletti & Radke, 2005). Artisans and craftsmen began to thrive in Italy during this period, especially in city-states such as Florence, Venice, and Milan. The rise of artisans led to the merchant class's development, which had broader effects on the Renaissance social order. Contrastingly, the Northern Renaissance (c. 1400-1600) saw few of the more extensive social changes that led to upheavals in social classes. The Northern Renaissance incorporated many of the artistic and cultural evolutions of the Italian Renaissance while further cultivating culture, politics, and industry in Northern Europe. During the Northern Renaissance, northern European countries and empires of note included Spanish Flanders, England, France, and the Holy Roman Empire (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015).

The Italian Renaissance and the Northern Renaissance differed in many ways; however, culturally, both revolved around the Roman Catholic Church. The Church facilitated change in all aspects of Renaissance life, from legitimizing a monarch's rule to regulating "immoral",

excessive, and non-pious dress of women (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015; Bond, 2018). During this period members of the upper class increasingly desired ways to visually distinguish themselves from the middle class and showcase their social identity (Freudenberger, 1963). Dress garnered further meaning during this period, especially amongst women, as visual social norms in dress became a crucial manner in which a woman could convey wealth, religious affiliation, political affiliation, coming of age, and other elements of self-expression (Muzzarelli, 2009; Rublack, 2011; Rublack, 2016). Aristocratic women, in particular, were noted for their social and financial ability to utilize dress identity to communicate loyalties, affiliations, and status (Currie, 2017; Rublack, 2011).

### **Purpose**

<span id="page-11-0"></span>In an effort to further explore how aristocratic Renaissance women expressed identity, I will critically analyze the painted portraits of Italian-born or married wives and mistresses from the 16th century. I hope to identify and interpret subvert and overt ways in which these women communicated their identity through dress and appearance in portraiture, a lasting form of legacy. I ask the research question:

### **Research Question**

<span id="page-11-1"></span>1. How did Renaissance Italian aristocratic wives and mistresses negotiate dress as a tool to communicate their positionalities and power?

### **Thesis Organization**

<span id="page-11-2"></span>The organization of my thesis is done to best articulate my intentions and execution of this study. The first chapter, Chapter One, contains the introduction to my study, which outlines this study's intent by contextualizing the period of study, presenting my research question and the purpose of the study, key concept definitions, and my positionality statement. Chapter Two

presents a comprehensive review of literature that outlines the European Renaissance with the corresponding cultural movements and details of the period's dress and identity conventions. Chapter Three outlines the methods and data collection process that will be utilized in this study. Chapters Four provides the results and discussion of my study. Then, Chapter Five includes an overall conclusion. Following Chapter Five is a reference list of all literature cited within this study. Two appendices are included, featuring images of the portraits analyzed, and my data.

### **Positionality Statement**

<span id="page-14-0"></span>A positionality statement is a form of disclaimer that provides information on a researcher's opinions and relationships with the subject of the study. Disclaimers such as these are imperative in qualitative research studies as to inform on possible biases. The development of personal relationships within studies is an expected and common occurrence, specifically with human based research (Pope & Patterson, 2019).

The idea of this study was solely based on personal experiences and interests. As an undergraduate student at Kent State University, I spent my first semester of college living in Florence, Italy. The former city-state is commonly referred to as the heart of the Italian Renaissance due to its connections with high power Renaissance families (i.e. Medici, Pazzi, Sforza, Orsini, etc.) and famous Renaissance artists (i.e. Botticelli, Da Vinci, Donatello, Brunelleschi). This immersion in Renaissance art and culture via architecture and an Italian Renaissance focused art history course shaped my appreciation for the period and its art. The weekly touring of Florentine museums like The Uffizi, Palazzo Pitti Costume Galleries, The Academia, The Bargello, and the Duomo Museum had a profound effect on me. During the first semester of my junior undergraduate year, I returned to Florence and the experiences from my first trip were further compounded by my focus on Italian fashion. It was through these experiences that I discovered my combined love for historical garments, fashion history, and fashion in art.

### **CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW**

### **Brief History of the Renaissance**

<span id="page-16-1"></span><span id="page-16-0"></span>The European Renaissance (1300-1600), including the Northern and Italian Renaissance, is widely regarded as the period of rebirth in the arts, sciences, and culture in post-medieval Europe (Rublack, 2011); the Italian Renaissance began around 1300, and the Northern Renaissance began closer to the 16 th century (Eire, 2016; Rublack, 2016; Wundram, 2016; Hagen & Hagen, 2018). The Renaissance era closely overlapped with the end of the Middle Ages, an era commonly signified by its combined war, plague, and overall political conflict. A variety of factors contributed to the exponential societal growth following the Middle Ages. Some of these factors include religious upheaval, socioeconomic change, increased innovation in the arts and sciences, and improved quality of life. The most prominent of these factors was the increased creativity and advanced artistry seen at the beginning of the Italian Renaissance.

Some of the most prolific artists emerged during the Italian Renaissance (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015), such as Giotto di Bondone (1267-1337), Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (1475-1564), Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519), Sandro Botticelli (1445-1510), and Donato di Niccolò Betto Bardi "Donatello" (1386-1466) (Wundram 2016; Hagen & Hagen, 2018). These and other Italian artists flourished and produced notable works due to Italy's loose ties to feudalism and numerous city-states such as Florence, Venice, and Milan. Italian culture encouraged the rise of skilled laborers and artists, with wealthy individuals and landed gentry acting as patrons to the arts, a high-status symbol (Wundram, 2016). Individuals communicated wealth, status, and/or piety by commissioning artwork for personal grandeur, religious devotion, or appreciation; these commissions contributed to the growing Renaissance Europe consumerist society (Paoletti & Radke, 2005).

The Northern Renaissance continued in the similar growth and development of Italian Renaissance with vast contributions to the arts and society. Major countries and empires including Spain, England, France, and the Holy Roman Empire exhibited power and influence during the Northern Renaissance. Spain, most notably, financed the exploration of the Americas under Christopher Columbus in 1492. Throughout his reign (1519-1558), Charles V, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, conquered and ruled much of Eastern Europe and Spain (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). Charles V would eventually acquire the Kingdoms of Sicily, Naples, and Sardinia along with northern Habsburg territories (**Error! Not a valid bookmark selfreference.**). The acquisitions of the largest number of European regions under one ruler aided in the proliferation of culture in mainland Europe (Goldthwaite, 1993).

Most European society members considered the Roman Catholic Church as one of the most influential organizations during the Renaissance, which helped facilitate change and growth. The Catholic Church's political power resulted from every European monarchs' rule having to be supported by the Pope, and numerous European nations declared Catholicism as the national religion; the Vatican's abuse of this power resulted in corruption and greed claims via quid pro quos between the Catholic Church and Catholic-practicing nations (Rublack, 2016).

The Catholic Church's rapidly expanded influence and perceived corruption resulted in numerous Christians separating from the Catholic Church in the 16th century, in what historians call The Reformation; during this movement, religious and political leaders including King

Henry VIII (1509-1547), John Calvin (1509-1564), and Martin Luther (1483-1546) respectively founded Anglicanism, Calvinism, and Lutheranism as denominations of Christianity outside of Catholicism (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015; Chapman & Dickey, 1990; Eire, 2016). Under King Henry VIII's rule, England separated from the Catholic Church, creating the Church of England, and declared Protestantism as England's national religion. Contrastingly, monarchs in Spain, France, and the Holy Roman Empire, led by Emperor Charles V, maintained their affiliations with the Catholic Church, leading to strife and war between the nations and England throughout the Renaissance. Consequently, Europe divided between the two prominent Christian dominations: Catholicism and Protestantism (Eire, 2016).

Similar to the Reformation, the printing press development in 1455 by Johannes Gutenberg in the Holy Roman Empire aided in the globalization and introspectiveness of commonersin the European Renaissance. The printing press enabled the wide spread and financially affordable dissemination of new Renaissance literature, academic research, and religious texts from key Reformation figures such as Martin Luther. With access to religious texts, people could now self-interpret the Bible, leading to members of the lower classes to join and support the Reformation. The printing press also made art and literature more accessible to the public. However, for several years only Latin based texts were printed, limiting accessibility to knowledge to the privileged elite and clergymen, yet this did not deter access to printed art (Eire, 2016). For example, Renaissance woodcut print artist Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) elevated Renaissance painting techniques using the printing press (Rublack, 2016). While the Italian Renaissance experienced prolific art-production, the printing press invention in the Northern Renaissance led to mass dissemination of art and culture in response to large concentrations of print houses in Norther European countries (Eire, 2016).

The significant growth of the arts and culture in Renaissance Europe led to flourishing national economies. For example, the arts, culture, and commerce saw an influx of foreign influence with the exploration of the Middle East and the Americas and an increase in trade between city-states and central European nations (Paoletti & Radke, 2005). One of the most distinguishing factors of the increased-economic growth in the Renaissance was the rise of the working class, also referred to as the merchant class (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). The increased access to social mobility for those in society's lower socioeconomic status provided hope towards upward mobility (Freudenberger, 1963). The increase in trade and industry allowed lower-status merchants, such as the Medici's of Florence and various artisans, to grow their wealth and status (Bercusson, 2014).

The middle-class development led to broader influences on the European economy and social order. The growth of consumerism within the Renaissance period in Italy can be directly attributed to the new class divides and the rise of the non-noble wealthy class. Social emulation, the desire for non-nobles to imitate the dress and behavioral practices of nobility, has been attributed to the demand for wealth consumption practices. This social practice became achievable with the accumulation of unprecedented levels of disposable income by members outside of the nobility, such as the Medici, unseen before this period. Around this new consumerist driven desire, the culture unique to Renaissance Italy emerged (Goldthwaite, 1993).

Freudenberger (1963) asserts that the middle class's growth was the birthplace for modern consumerism and capitalism, with Goldthwaite (1993) stating "Art [and dress] is an index to culture not only for the style in which it is made… but also for its mere existence as a consumer object," (p. 6). This new emphasis on materialism in Renaissance Europe resulted in a surge in the textile and dress industries (McCall, 2017).

### <span id="page-21-0"></span>**The Renaissance Textile and Dress Industry**

The growing emphasis on materialism influenced the surge of fashionable dress and innovative-textile production. Throughout the 14th century, the Florence, Venice, Genoa, Prato, and Lucca city-states were centers of Renaissance textile production; as Italian explorers learned sericulture in Eastern Asia in this period before bringing the knowledge back to Europe, these city-states began creating intricate textiles with silk. The 14th century was a period in which a significant shift in European-textile production occurred. As luxury textiles were popularized amongst the merchant class and the aristocracy a number of Italian city-states became prominent-production centers high quality textiles (Monnas, 1993; Tortora & Marcketti, 2015).

Florence, Venice, Genoa, and Lucca were most notable for their silk-textile industries and wool-based textiles (Herald, 1993a; Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). Italian-textile manufacturers imported silk and then incorporated them into textiles ranging from delicate linings to intricate-damask weaves (Monnas, 1993). As the silk-textile industry grew, Italiantextile manufacturers began cultivating their own silk (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015) and sourced other textile fibers (e.g., wool) from countries in Northern Europe, such as England (Monnas, 1993).

Following the birth of sericulture in Europe, in the 16th century, French (Avignon, Lyons, and Tours) and German cities (Augsburg, Cologne, and Nuremberg) also became silk-textile production centers (Hayward, 2017). As silk production permeated throughout Europe, Asian aesthetics heavily influenced textiles, with patterns from China, India, and Persia appearing first on Italian textiles around the 15th century. Some historians attribute the overall improved quality of Italian and Northern Renaissance textiles to the weaving-machine innovations and improvements (Currie, 2017; Harris, 1993b).

Renaissance inventors advanced the efficiency of weaving mechanisms, such as looms; the treadle loom and drawloom, which were popular at the time, produced more intricate textile designs than those produced by hand. Weavers also used newly developed treadle-powered thread spinners and a bobbin-and-flyer device, allowing them to spin fibers into threads more efficiently and weave faster. These new devices could also have contributed to satin and velvet's creation or popularization (Harris, 1993b; Tortora & Marcketti, 2015) Velvet, not frequently seen in garments before the 14th century, represented the epitome of luxurious Italian textiles, which artists heavily depicted in royal portraits (Herald, 1993a).

The rise of the merchant class and thus skilled tailors, combined with access to new highquality textiles, led to a surge in unique garment designs. The wealthy European individuals embraced these new designs, and those from a lower socio-economic status benefited from the growing second-hand clothing market (Currie, 2017; Tortora & Marcketti, 2015).

### **Brief History of Renaissance Dress**

### <span id="page-22-1"></span><span id="page-22-0"></span>**Dress and Social Identity**

During the European Renaissance, advances in textile and garment constructions were evident in all class levels, and garment styles varied between countries, regions, and cities. In response to the available diverse-dress elements, individuals such as Matthäus Schwarz (*Little Book of Costumes [Trachtenbuch]*), Cesare Vecellio (*Clothes Ancient to Modern of Different Parts of the World [Degli habiti antichi et moderni di diversi parti del mondo]*), Christopher Weidetz (*Book of Costumes [Trachtenbuch]*), and Christopher von Sternsee created some of the first documented fashion histories by making or commissioning manuscripts that detailed the dress style preferences across Renaissance Europe (Bond, 2018; Rublack, 2016). Some historians

believe the relationship between dress, identity, and self-expression influenced the value placed upon fashion and style during this period (Freudenberger, 1963; Worth, 2020).

Individuals used dress to distinguish one's social class as a result of the growing merchant class. The upper echelons of society desired wealthy visual representations on the body to differentiate themselves from those aspiring to the landed gentry's wealth (Freudenberger, 1963). Legislation, known as sumptuary laws, granted doctors, knights, lawyers, and some artisans, dress privileges that could distinguish them from the merchant class; these privileges included wearing specific colors or an excess fabric amount (Muzzarelli, 2009). Using luxury fashion and clothing as a status symbol became so integral to Renaissance culture that gifts of luxurious fabrics and clothes were common amongst the aristocracy and their friends (Hayward, 2017).

Numerous sumptuary laws ensured that garments signifying wealth and status were exclusive to society's elites to maintain visual class boundaries. Individuals such as King Henry VIII used legislation to reserve colors and textiles, such as fur, for royal family members. Additionally, members of specific knighthoods, orders, and other elite-social organizations communicated affiliation through dress and accessories. Richardson (2017) outlined the importance of dress distinctions predicting that "these robes and accoutrements had a stability of form that symbolized the continuity of dynasties, and they were available only to the monarch and the top of nobility" (p. 120). Legislation and other social conventions governing dress were means to construct class barriers during the merchant class's rise, who now had access to luxury only previously available to the aristocracy (Richardson, 2017).

While wealthy individuals primarily utilized dress to divide and distinguish class status, dress was also a means to unite social classes. Elements of dress conveyed religious affiliations, political affiliations, coming of age, and even differentiation between wed and unwed women.

However, in the Renaissance, wealth was one of the principal traits to be conveyed through dress (Rublack, 2011).

### <span id="page-24-0"></span>**Clothing**

The desire to showcase one's wealth through clothing is apparent in the numerous design and detail innovations that emerged during the Renaissance; during this time, tailors and dress makers created garments that quickly distinguished themselves from the Late Middle Ages fashions due to the increased contributions of skilled tailors and artisans (Rublack, 2011; Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). Rublack (2011) theorizes that a person's clothing was part of a person's "psychic landscape" (p. 25) and thus tied to their identity. Amongst some historians, the Renaissance also denotes early accounts in which women's dress had meaning or value in Europe (Cox-Rearick, 2009; Freudenberger, 1963). As such, Italian dress specifically often aimed to showcase an individual's complexity and identity through elaborate dress.

The Italian Renaissance features some of the earliest changes from the Late Middle Ages to Renaissance fashions. Advancements in tailoring popularized unique sleeve styles for both men and women. The more notable sleeve styles incorporated sleeve slashing, sleeves laced up to the armhole, or even detachable sleeves, all of which were visually identifiable as Italian by the 16th century (Currie, 2017).

While sleeve styles showcased Italian tailoring expertise, gowns and doublet styles further demonstrated the growing taste for elaborate garments (Rublack, 2011). Women's gowns featured a modest elegance, with the Italian equivalent of a chemise (camicia) serving as decorative edgings of the neckline and cuffs, open underarm, and to fill in sleeve slashings [\(Figure 2\)](#page-26-0). Similarly, Italian men's dress featured decorated skirted-waist-length doublets and jackets. In addition to opulently decorated camicie, Italian Renaissance gowns and doublets

featured simple style-lines as not to distract from the lavish textiles. Emphasis on more simplistic silhouettes showcasing hand-crafted Italian textiles was an essential characteristic of Italian dress (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). Period authors, such as Baldassare Castiglione, were some of the earliest accounts to note that Italian dress was more curated and sophisticated than German, French, and Spanish dress (Castiglione, 1959/1528).

![](_page_26_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Figure 2. Portrait of a Man and Woman at a Casement, c. 1440 From the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art by Fra Filippo Lippi, Italian, c. 1440,** *Portrait of a Woman with a Man at Casement* **(https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436896?)**

<span id="page-26-0"></span>Italian style of this period featured a number of distinguishable features; however, due to numerous foreign political conflicts in various Italian principalities, Spanish dress trends became prevalent as early as the 14 th century. Traders, politicos, and consorts such as Eleonora di Toledo facilitated the arrival of "dress *alla Spagnola* [of the Spanish]" (p. 40) to Italy (Cox-Rearick, 2009). In addition to Spanish trends gaining prominence in Italian women's styles, Cox-Rearick quotes Baldassare Castiglione as noting, "For in this [male dress in Italy] we see an infinite

variety: some dressing after the French manner, some after the Spanish, some wishing to appear German; nor are those lacking who dress in the style of Turks," (Cox-Rearick, 2009, p. 51).

Like Italian trends, Spanish womenswear trends were most distinguished by silhouette elements, such as sleeve styles and waistlines. The sleeves on Spanish gowns were typically exceptionally voluminous (Cox-Rearick, 2009). Spanish waistlines were V-shaped to complement the low, wide, and square necklines (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). During Queen Isabella's reign (1470s), the cone-shaped skirt style, verdugado, was popularized (Wunder, 2015). This skirt style, in addition to the V-shaped waistline, was characteristic of Spanish dress during the Renaissance and prevailed in numerous Spanish conquered regions. Vecellio (1859/1590) makes a note of this skirt style when describing the dress of a Napolitana (a woman from Naples) noblewomen, denoting it as "verducato" (p. 465) in Italian. The style also appears in numerous of Vecellio's woodcut prints of the dress of Italian principalities, Republics, and city-states such as Sicily, Naples, Rome, and Venice (Vecellio, 1859/1590).

While the latter half of the Italian Renaissance became increasingly influenced by Spanish styles, Italian and Northern Renaissance dress styles were mostly distinct from each other. Some period and modern Northern Renaissance historians promote the idea that Northern Renaissance dress was more extravagant, even gaudy (Castiglione, 1959/1528; Rublack, 2011; Tortora & Marcketti, 2015).

Following the various conquests under the Spanish-styled Habsburgs, regions such as the Netherlands began to manifest Spanish-inspired garments. The Dutch *vliegerkostuum* ("flyergown") was a skirt, bodice, and sleeveless over-gown ensemble inspired by 16th-century Spanish trends. The vliegerkostuum showcased other Spanish characteristics as the costume was

typically black (Chapman & Dickey, 1990). The color black was a distinctly Spanish gown or doublet color as the color harkened to the Queen Isabella of Spain (Cox-Rearick, 2009).

Numerous styles prevailed across Europe due largely to the Holy Roman Empire's conquests and multiple foreign marriages. In addition to Eleonora di Toledo's marriage, Katherine of Aragon, a Spanish queen, married King Henry VIII of England in 1509, thus spreading numerous Spanish-styles to England (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). Queen Katherine most notably popularized the Spanish embroidery technique, blackwork to English sensibilities (Gostelow, 1998).

Heightened attention was paid to the dress of the members of the aristocracy in this period. The elite fueled the advent of new levels of luxury to distinguish themselves from the merchant class further. The heart of such aspirations were hand-crafted textiles; such rare and revered textiles were gifted in yardage for prestige (Hayward, 2017).

### <span id="page-28-0"></span>**Textiles**

Textiles were the foundation of the luxury Renaissance fashions. As previously mentioned, silk became popularized in Europe during the Renaissance and numerous other textile modifications and inventions. Silk became the chosen textile fiber of the wealthy, with velvet weaving techniques allowing velvet to be considered a luxury textile. Velvet as a textile first appeared in Italy in the late 13th century, and during the 14th century, voided velvet patterns (cheeks, stripes, and multi-colored patterns) were created and popularized [\(Figure 3\)](#page-29-0). However, the importation of tartar cloth from the Mongol Empire and the Asian continent shaped European textile designers' understanding of textile patterns, symmetry, and dynamic design (Herald, 1993a).

![](_page_29_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Figure 3. Medici Emblem in Voided Velvet, c. late 16th century** From the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, late 16th - century, *Polychrome velvet with a variation on a Medici emblem* (https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/227206)

<span id="page-29-0"></span>Textiles before the establishment of 13th and 14th -century trade routes featured a variety of Arabic design elements. Arabic designs' geometric and aniconic styles were mirrored in Spanish textiles at the beginning of the Renaissance. The lotus motif and pattern were also frequently seen in Spanish art and textiles in the 14th -century (Herald, 1993b). Prior to trade with the Mongol Empire and Eastern Asian cultures, Sassanian design motifs such as the roundel dominated textile design across Europe (Herald, 1993a).

As a result of trade with the Middle East and Eastern Asia during this period, numerous textile designs and motifs were adapted. In Italy, motifs and iconography were frequently specific to the area of textile production. In the 15th century, Venetian textiles were easily denoted by the presence of roundels with griffins or lions (the symbol of Venice). In Lucca, roundels with griffins were also present, along with birds such as parrots, lambs of God, deer, or flowers. The popular Italian motifs, pine leaves, birds, and other small animals, scenes of hunters, religious subjects, and court scenes (the latter three mostly featuring tapestries and ecclesiastical vestments) were seen throughout the territories of Italian peninsula. By the 15th century, the pomegranate (a symbol of fertility), pinecones, thistles, or pineapples were the preferred motifs (Harris, 1993a).

Similarly, in England, during the 14th-century, birds and plants were featured on textiles (Herald, 1993a). The mid-16th century expansion of Asian trade routes brought an increased design influence from Chinese and Mamluk textile designs. Depictions of carnations, roses, tulips, and palmettes began to appear frequently (Hayward, 2017). Consequently, most textiles throughout the Renaissance featured motifs of vegetation and animals (Herald, 1993a). Floral and vegetation motifs were not relegated to woven textiles but were also featured in lace and occasionally knit garments. Lace is theorized to have originated between the late 15th and 16th centuries (Hayward, 2017; Levey, 1993). Lace production was concentrated in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, with Flanders as a source of exceptionally skilled lace production (Levey, 1993). Renaissance lace was made utilizing two techniques: bobbin lace and needle lace (Hayward, 2017). Needle lace originated from openwork embroidery as it is created on woven textiles and was created using only one needle [\(Figure 4\)](#page-31-0) In contrast, bobbin lace was an intricate lace-making process that utilized numerous threads attached to bobbins interlaced or braided together over a paper pattern with the threads grounded to a pillow (Harris, 1993a).

<span id="page-31-0"></span>Bobbin lace predates needle lace and is believed to have originated in Italy due to the use of silk thread in early examples of bobbin lace **(**[Figure 5](#page-32-2)**)** and Italy's affinity for sericulture in the first half of the Renaissance (Levey, 1993). Bobbin lace was known under numerous names across Europe: Pillow lace, bone lace (England, for the bobbins bone composition), dentelle (France), merletto (Italy), and puntas (Spain) (Harris, 1993a, Hayward, 2017). Like needle lace, bobbin lace was used as a subtle trimming at the beginning of the Renaissance but grew to a more prominent dress design element. Needle lace is thought to have originated in the early 16th century. Despite being popular in the latter half of the Renaissance, needle lace became exceptionally popular during the subsequent Baroque era (Levey, 1993).

<span id="page-32-2"></span>Renaissance-era textiles and fashion elements represented a profound shift in the way individuals negotiated dress and identity that would proliferate periods to come. Numerous fashion and textile innovations resulted from improved technology, social mobility, and sociopolitical influences. During the Renaissance, dress was recognized as a way to communicate identity and allegiances and a means to exert control (Freudenberger, 1963).

### **Political Influences on Renaissance Dress**

### <span id="page-32-1"></span><span id="page-32-0"></span>**Sumptuary laws**

Legal and social laws regulating dress, style, and textiles were created at a disproportionate rate during the Renaissance. Sumptuary laws commonly refer to legislation used to restrict the consumption of specific (often luxury) goods targeting a specific socio-economic group (Tortora & Keiser, 2014). This type of legislation aimed to distinguish wealthy aristocratic groups from the merchant class and peasant class and identify religious affiliations and political/ national allegiances (Muzzarelli, 2009; Rublack, 2011; Silverman, 2013).

Society's upper echelons, such as royalty, members of the aristocracy, and high ranking members of the Catholic Church (i.e., the Pope and cardinals), typically created sumptuary laws (Bond, 2018). Sumptuary legislation targeting the merchant and peasant class was frequently motivated by a desire to distinguish the landed gentry from the working class and poor

(Freudenberger, 1963). As a result of the booming textile industry, dyed garments were more accessible, even colors previously only accessible to royalty and the landed gentry (Hayward, 2017). Subsequently, sumptuary legislation was implemented to reserve the wearing of specific colors to members of the upper class (Muzzarelli, 2009). Such legislation often hid the real objective of forbidding cross-class dressing in the guise of supporting pious acts such as avoiding the sin of pride (Worth, 2020). Knights, lawyers, doctors, and individuals involved in the arts were some of the few to straddle the line between the merchant class and the aristocracy. Those with the aforementioned job titles were often singled out in sumptuary legislation with specific dress guidelines to visually represent their social status and class visual these guidelines were not limited to the employed individual but their families as well. The wives, daughters, and sons of these respected gentlemen were also entitled to lavish visual displays of status (Muzzarelli, 2009). For example, a sumptuary law created by Queen Elizabeth I in 1574, outlined the types of textiles to be worn by men and their wives, from dukes, knights, and secretaries to stable equires (Dyson, 1618).

While sumptuary legislation could offer some Renaissance groups elegant displays of wealth, the same legislation could be used for religious identification and persecution. Being closely affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church was ideal in most Renaissance societies. However, with the birth of the Catholic Reformation and other separations from the Church, visually distinguishing oneself as a loyal Catholic was necessary (Rublack, 2016). Wearing a specific hat style, color, or jewelry with religious iconography could distinguish an individual as being a member of the three major religious sects in Europe at the time: Catholicism, Protestantism, and Judaism (Rublack, 2016; Silverman, 2013).

Catholics and Protestants typically identified themselves by wearing the color red (the latter group sported a lighter shade of red than the former). Red itself thus became, and remains to be, a visual representation of a commitment to the broader Christian community (Rublack, 2016). In contrast, the violently persecuted Jewish community was legally commanded to wear variations of a flat cap hat style, patches, or the color yellow to visually distinguish themselves from Christians. In other cases, Jewish religious texts such as the Torah and the Talmud gave instructions on how to dress to visually separate Jewish individuals from the gentile (Jablon, 2015; Silverman, 2013).

Sumptuary legislation related to displaying religious affiliations was significantly more strict than politically motivated legislation. Under King Henry VIII, in England, political and economic sumptuary legislation was prevalent at the beginning of the Northern Renaissance. Some of the initial legislation aimed at supporting local and national industries instead of imports. As a result, dress-specific sumptuary laws that included women were not seen in England until 1574, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (Worth, 2020). Such trends are in direct contrast to Italian sumptuary legislation that targeted women throughout the 15th century. Many Italian sumptuary laws of the time stemmed from the decrees of the Catholic Church. The Church created legislation that encouraged modesty and pious dress in order to gain further compliance with the Church's teachings. However, Church sumptuary laws were notably circumvented by members of the aristocracy and royal classes under the guise that displaying wealth and luxury was their moral and social duty (Killerby, 1999).

### <span id="page-34-0"></span>**Cross-cultural royal marriages**

During the European Renaissance, connections to the Church were not the only means to access power and influence. Political marriages were commonplace amongst the upper echelons

of society. Such marriages have lent to some of the most powerful political and social alliances in European history (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). These marriages inevitably led to cultural exchanges that included styles of dress. Bridgeman (2010) theorized that military conquest and cultural exchange via trade were large contributing factors to xenophobic feelings towards individuals (foreign brides and consorts) and foreign dress. However, some researchers have found that royal and non-royal consorts garnered celebrity-level attention despite prejudiced feelings. As a result, heightened attention was paid to the dress of these women (Currie, 2017). According to Worth (2020), "Fabric and clothing [during this period] became powerful indicators and, significantly, symbols of class assertion, abnegation, and conflict" (p. 33), all characteristics that foreign consorts would want to signify in their new homes. Such attention furthered women's ability to utilize dress to emphasize emotional and political loyalties (Rublack, 2011).

Previously mentioned aristocrats such as Eleonora di Toledo and Eléonore d'Austriche brought about dramatic style and fashion changes to their husbands' countries of Italy and France respectively from their own homelands (Cox-Rearick, 2009). Historians note both women's ability to maintain their home country's dress for some time after their marriage (Cox-Rearick, 2009; Currie, 2017). Eleonora di Toledo, a Spanish princess, married into the Medici dynasty (1539) to legitimatize the Medici duchy in Florence. This political marriage was not well received in Florence due to di Toledo's outwardly Spanish appearance and resistance to conform to Florentine styles and traditions (Cox-Rearick, 2009).

Eléonore d'Austriche was married twice, her husbands both being foreign rulers. Her first marriage to King Manuel of Portugal (1518) saw her maintaining Spanish and Austro-German dress (having grown up in Flanders as a Spanish Habsburg princess). Following her husband's

death in 1521, she married King François I of France (1530) in a political alliance for her brother Emperor Charles V. During the first seven years of their marriage Eléonore was allowed to maintain her Spanish fashions and thus display loyalty to her brother the Emperor. Following those seven years, Eléonore was depicted and seen exclusively in French styles until her husband's death (Cox-Rearick, 2009).

More notably than Eleonora di Toledo and Eléonore d'Austriche were royal consorts of France, Spain, England, and Scotland, and the Austro-German empire under Emperor Charles V. King Henry VIII most notably wed Spanish princess, Katherine of Aragon, and Austro-German princess Anne of Cleves during his reign as King of England, Wales, and Scotland. These marriages brought both minor (blackwork) and significant style changes (the popularization of the color black at court) to English sensibilities. Similarly, King Henry II of France married Catherine de' Medici of Florence, bringing numerous Italian influences to the French court. Catherine championed the increased inclination and importation of luxurious Italian textiles and garments in France. She became patron to Italian tailors, dressmakers, cooks, perfumers, and artisans by bringing them to France. For much of the Northern Renaissance, Italian luxury goods prevailed in France due to Catherine de' Medici until Henry IV championed French industry during his rule (1589-1610) (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015).

Fashion, style, and dress in the European Renaissance were overwhelmingly influenced by changing perceptions of class and identity (Worth, 2020). The changing social order influenced by political events such as the Catholic Reformation and an increase in royal political marriages, and social influences such as the advent of the printing press and trade with the East and Middle East (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). These factors allowed for a change in the way

women, specifically women of the aristocracy and royal families, were perceived by their societal peers.

### **CHAPTER 3. RESEARCH METHODS**

### **Historic Method**

<span id="page-38-1"></span><span id="page-38-0"></span>In my research, I used a historic method approach, a technique where records and surviving materials of the past are critically analyzed (Gottschalk, 1969). This method can be applied to analyze historical events in a specific context, outside of summarizing or narrating historical events (Fitzpatrick, 2007). Fitzpatrick describes the goals of the historical method as "[a] process [that] can provide a useful analysis of the recent past, as well as an evaluation of events and circumstances that have been well-tempered by time" (p. 406).

### <span id="page-38-2"></span>**Historic Method: Art Analysis**

### *Primary sources*

The primary sources for data collection were Renaissance women portraits. Mida (2020) identified painted portraits as an ideal medium of data for this time period: "In commissioning a portrait, most sitters hope for a flattering representation and will carefully select their clothing…, and this allows the dress detective to analyze the portrait to consider the sitter's presentation of social identity through dress" (p. 100). Mida (2020) is an art specific iteration of Mida and Kim (2015)'s *The Dress Detective*, one of the prominent texts for analyzing historic fashion imagery.

My research focused on influential Renaissance women who lived during the 16th century and were either born or lived in Italy, including:

- 1. Caterina Sforza (Ettlinger, 1994)
- 2. Bianca Maria Sforza (Rill, 1968)
- 3. Cecilia Gallerani (Dec & Wałek, n.d.)
- 4. Giulia Farnese (Bradford, 2004)
- 5. Isabella d'Este (Cockram, 2013)

- 6. Lucrezia Borgia (Ghirardo, 2008)
- 7. Margherita Paleologo (Clayton & Whitaker, 2007)
- 8. Eleonora di Toledo (Cox-Rearick, 2009)
- 9. Bianca Cappello (Musacchio, 2019)

These women were identified as having noted contributions to the arts through their patronage in addition to their overall contributions to history and fashion history. The selected women were also selected on the basis that they have not been frequently discussed in fashion history scholarship (e.g., historians have extensively discussed Queen Elizabeth). In addition to their various historic contributions, these women were born or married into power and privilege. That is, each of these women wielded power by direct possession of it, by proxy, or by association through their husbands', lovers', or fathers' status; they were born into families of moderate to immense wealth (regardless of being born legitimate or illegitimate), allowing them social advancement mobility and access to political and social power.

Eleonora di Toledo was noted for her foreign marriage and utilizing dress to communicate her social and political allegiances (Cox-Rearick, 2009). Caterina Sforza, Bianca Maria Sforza, Lucrezia Borgia, and Isabella d'Este were identified as women born into families of immense power (Sforza Duchy of Milan, Borgia Papal Dynasty, and d'Este Duchy of Ferrara [paternal] and Trastámara Monarchy of Naples [maternal]) during this period. These families that these women were born into are representative of some of the most powerful families in Italy and Europe as a result of political connections and strategically curated lineage and marriages (Ettlinger, 1994; Ghirardo, 2008; Cockram, 2013). Contrastingly, Margherita Paleologo married into a family of immense power, the Gonzaga Duchy of Mantua, representing one of the most common methods for a middle tier noble woman to attain vast political or social

power during the Renaissance (Clayton & Whitaker, 2007). Giulia Farnese, Bianca Cappello, and Cecilia Gallerani, all mistresses, represent a group of women that were closely associated to vast power, and using alternative methods from marriage, managed to attain comparative levels of power and influence by association (Dec & Wałek, n.d.; Musacchio, 2019).

The aforementioned women were selected over arguably more prolific 16th century Renaissance women for numerous reasons. First, the focus of this study was confined to Italian women (by birth or marriage), and as such many of the "mainstream" heroines of the 16th century, such as Catherine of Aragon, Queen Elizabeth I, and Mary Queen of Scots, were excluded. I did not include more than about two women from the same family (connected by birth or marriage) in an effort to provide a diverse perspective of Italian noblewomen. Numerous women from the Houses of Gonzaga, Medici, and Sforza would have provided rich analysis, however this would skew the focus of the study towards a particular noble family of the Italian Renaissance since they have upwards of 10 women per family. Bianca Cappello is a slight exception to this rule as she was a mistress before she was a wife and provides a unique analysis to further discussions on the power of a mistress. In Table 1, I outline the women chosen for this study.

Women such as these have clear and frequently discussed links to power and influence. These women represent a diverse chronicle of the numerous ways in which women could obtain and maintain power in the 16th century. In critically analyzing their portraits, I uncovered how these depictions communicated power and identity via dress in the portraits.

### *Source Collection*

Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, all of the studied portraits were identified in government and museum online databases and documented using the available photographed images of these paintings. Such online databases include the Europeana Collection, Art UK

database, Useum database, the Bildindex database, the Uffizi Galleries, the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A), the Louvre, the Royal Collection Trust, the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery (U.S.), the National Portrait Gallery (U.K.), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met), the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna, the National Museum Krakow, Lindenau-Museum Altenburg, Castel Sant'Angelo, and the National Gallery of Victoria Melbourne. The aforementioned online museum catalogs and databases were identified because they have significant Renaissance painting collections and text-based searching strategies (Sikarskie, 2020).

In the case in which the subject's (woman's) name did not appear in the title of the portrait (i.e., Portrait of Isabella d'Este), text-based searching strategies such as truncation and parenthetical statements (i.e., "Giulia" AND "Farnese") were utilized. In some instances, first names could be misspelled, and variations of names were also searched (i.e., "Eleonore de Toledo" OR "Eleonora de Medici" OR "Eleonora di Toldeo"). In cases in which none of these methods worked, portraits of associated historical figures were researched. For example, when databases' search functions did not return results for the subject, I searched the names of her husband, lover, and/or children.

Once a portrait was identified within a database, the title, artist, date, location (museum or database name), and weblink (URL link to the database) of the portrait was documented in an Excel spreadsheet row corresponding to the woman featured in the portrait. Due to limited accessibility and credibility issues, the number of portraits per woman was limited to between one and four portraits. Art history studies that utilized portrait analysis with an emphasis on a similar time period analyzed a total of four to twenty portraits (Cooper & Hadfield, 2012 [analyzed 4 portraits]; Faraday, 2019 [analyzed 10 portraits]; Grootenboer, 2010 [analyzed 6

portraits]; Wolfthal, 2013 [analyzed 20 portraits]). In similar academic studies, such as the doctoral dissertation by McBurney (2014), they analyzed fifty-six portraits, while a more comprehensive doctoral study by Valiela (2014) analyzed 136 busts or engravings. In Table 2, I outline the women under study and their respective portraits with a total of twenty-one portraits analyzed.

### <span id="page-45-0"></span>**Data analysis**

After obtaining digital access to the selected portraits, I followed Mida's (2020) method in *Reading Fashion in Art*, which provides a comprehensive seventy-question checklist for interpreting fashion in multiple visual art forms. Mida (2020) describes her approach to art analysis as "the slow approach to seeing" (p. 15), which is divided into three steps: observation (40 questions), reflection (35 questions), and interpretation (5 questions). The observation step aims to gather information about the artwork, such as artist information, composition, details about the painted fashioned body, and other artistic stylistic qualities. The reflection step offers questions that aim to analyze and contextualize observations. This step allows for a detailed analysis of elements of dress featured in the paintings. Finally, the interpretation step aims to tie

are from Mida's checklist (Table 3). Analysis results of each step for each portrait are included

in Appendix B.

In combination with Mida's interpretation checklist, I also used a constant comparative method to help identify overarching themes. In this process, I used open coding, which is the process of identifying all possible ideas in the data using short phrases or words. After open coding, I began axial coding to collapse these ideas into larger themes (Esterberg, 2002). In selective coding, I identified larger themes and subthemes (Creswell, 2007).

## <span id="page-49-0"></span>**Validity**

Validity was achieved through obtaining credible primary sources. In this study I defined "credible" portraiture as those that scholars have agreed upon the identity of the sitter or sitters. I analyzed portraits from recognized databases and museums in lieu of other locations due to their credibility as educational sources. The source locations identified were all publicly recognized institutions or had a .gov or .org URL (Sikarskie, 2020). Additionally, the selected portraits are dated to within the lifetime of the women or within the 16th century in order to obtain a more credible depiction of the women (Gottschalk, 1969; Fitzpatrick, 2007; Mida, 2020). Women with a lack of credible portraits were excluded from this study.

### **CHAPTER 4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

<span id="page-51-0"></span>After analyzing the dress identities and conveyed identities of Caterina Sforza, Bianca Maria Sforza, Cecilia Gallerani, Giulia Farnese, Isabella d'Este, Lucrezia Borgia, Margherita Paleologo, Eleonora di Toledo, and Bianca Cappello, within their 21 portraits spanning over a century, from 1475 to 1601, it is evident that these women share much more than their social status. While many of the women spent a majority of their adult lives in Italy, the combination of their heritages, birthplaces, families, and husbands' culture fosters an intersectional identity both shared and unique to each of them.

One of the most prominent ideas conveyed in many of the portraits was status. Status, within the Renaissance was a complex concept, especially in Renaissance Italy where distinctions between non-noble wealthy and noble existed. Each of the nine women analyzed held some form of title or position within the aristocracy in their lifetime. However, not every woman was born with these titles, and as such their need to assert their new identities manifests in numerous ways, such as social emulation of dress. In addition to contending with class articulation these women had to communicate and affirm their willingness to comply with social expectations such as providing their husbands with an heir or maintaining piety. The portraits of each of these nine women demonstrate the unique ways that the various artists conveyed the multidimensional identities these women wanted, be it through innovative dress styles that referenced loyalty to their home or through fortresses in the background that implied political and personal strength.

### **Caterina Sforza**

<span id="page-51-1"></span>As the daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza (1444-1476) and his mistress Lucrezia Landriani (b. 1440), Caterina was born (b. 1462/1463) illegitimate. In 1477, she was legitimized

by her father, which allowed her the social mobility akin to her paternal half-sisters (de Vries, 2010; Hairston, 2000). As noted by Pasolini (1913) and Hairston (2000) in evidence from letters written to her father, Caterina was incredibly intelligent and tutored alongside her brothers, a possible explanation for her inclination to alchemy and the healing arts, as conveyed her portraiture by her interactions with alchemical elements such as jasmine. Caterina would have been raised in one of the most opulent courts in Europe from her birth until her first marriage to Girolamo Riario (1443-1488) in 1477 (Pasolini, 1913).

Between 1480 and 1490 Caterina and her husband were granted control over Forlì in addition to Girolamo's jurisdiction over Imola, granted by his uncle Pope Sixtus IV (Hairston, 2000; Pasolini, 1913; de Vries, 2010). Caterina's marriage to Girolamo produced seven children before Girolamo's assassination on April 14, 1488, which subsequently resulted in the kidnapping of Caterina and the rest of her family in Forlì. The story first recounted by Machiavelli in his writings the *Discourses*, *the Florentine Histories*, and briefly in the *Prince*, describes Caterina refusing to surrender to her captors, and upon threat to her children she supposedly lifted her skirts for the crowd below to see her female genitalia claiming she could always have more children (Hairston, 2000). In Machiavelli's writings he depicts Caterina as the cunning, cold, woman that would let her children die to protect her rule of Romagna (de Vries, 2003).

Following Girolamo's assassination and the siege of Forlì, Caterina maintained the appearance of a widow, as she acted as regent for her eldest son Ottaviano Riario (1479-1523) who was only 9 years old at the time of his father's death. Caterina was a shrewd and cunning diplomat as she ruled Forlì and Imola and protected the region from domestic and foreign invasions. Despite this impressive resume, she maintained the garb of a widow in official

depictions of herself including a self-commissioned coin following the approval of her regency in 1488 (de Vries, 2003). During her regency she remarried twice, first to Giacomo Feo (1471- 1495) in c. 1490 and to Giovanni Pier Francesco de' Medici (1467-1498) in c. 1498, having more children by both men (de Vries, 2003). Following Giovanni's death, Caterina's son with him was the only living male heir, making Caterina the grandmother of all subsequent rulers of Florence, including Duke Cosimo de' Medici, husband of Eleonora di Toledo. Caterina Sforza died in 1509 (de Vries, 2003).

### <span id="page-53-0"></span>**Botticelli Portrait, c. 1475 (p. [120\)](#page-129-0)**

This portrait by Sandro Botticelli (1445-1510) marks one of the artist's earlier works. A student under Fra Filippo Lippi (1406-1469), a noted Florentine painter, and Andrea Verrocchio, Botticelli was heavily inspired in his early works by Pollaiuolo. He was enlisted by Lorenzo de' Medici, ancestor to Caterina's third husband, for a number of portraits and landscapes. Vasari notes that Botticelli is well known for his depiction of beautiful women and emphasis on facial beauty, as evidenced in this portrait of the young Caterina (Vasari, 1912-1915/1550-1568; Salvini, 1965; Wundram, 2016). Botticelli's works were also noted for his attention to realistic movement and his advance use of depth within the background of his works without drawing attention away from the main figures depicted (Wundram, 2016).

At the suggested time of the painting of this portrait (c. 1475) Caterina was about to or had recently wed Girolamo Riario in 1477 (Pasolini, 1913). The evidence of this painting being commissioned after her marriage is present in her dress, hair, and background elements present in the composition that present a strong intent of identity communication. Furthermore, the inclusion of numerous dress and background elements indicate that Caterina aimed to emulate Saint Catherine of Alexandria in this portrait. As the niece-in-law to Pope Sixtus IV, there would naturally have been specific expectations of Caterina while she resided in Rome during this period (De Vries, 2003). This attention to the attributes of St. Catherine marks a period in which attention to classicism was heightened. As St. Catherine, a princess, was a champion of Christianity in pre-Christian times in Alexandria her story would likely be very popular during this period. Beauty and intelligence in women were becoming seemingly valued attributes as they mimicked the characteristics of female saints, ancient women such as Helen of Troy, and aided in the classicism mentality of knowledge (Stollhans, 2007). It would appear an apt choice for Caterina to want to adapt the characteristics of St. Catherine of Alexandria within her portraiture.

The similarities between the two women do not stop at their names. St. Catherine was the daughter of a king, in the same way Caterina was the daughter of a powerful duke. Caterina's intelligence was noted throughout the Renaissance, with period accounts vilifying her (a response to her perceived threat towards the patriarchal rule of society) in response to her shrewd intelligence in the same way in which St. Catherine was martyred for similar characteristics in the service of Christianity (Pasolini, 1913; Hairston, 2000; de Vries, 2003; Stollhans, 2007). Caterina's alignment with St. Catherine notably takes away from her more traditionally emphasized traits of married women in portraiture during this period (i.e., her breasts, and stomach/ womb).

Caterina's dress choice disguising references to her sexual being highlights her other capabilities, as a highly intellectual woman, a non-sexual being, and most importantly for her during this period, a devout woman to God, the Church, and the Pope. She appears to be wearing a white long-sleeved gown with heavily pleated or gathered sleeves, and a heavily faded green and red trimmed mantle, a style of cape or over cloak, that disguises her entire body. The

sleeveless mantle appears to be loosely worn and possibly clasped together in the front. The mantle in which she is dressed in mimics that worn by women of this period, but also resembles the mantles in which saints are depicted in religious works.

Notably, Caterina lacks any embellishment in her dress, likely a further indicator of her allegorical depiction as Saint Catherine of Alexandria. However, Caterina appears to have a black thread/ rope around her neck, most likely attached to a crucifix. Her halo can be described as an accessory; however, this is the period convention of identifying saints in art. Additionally, in this portrait Caterina's hair has golden ribbon wrapped in a manner to tie back her hair. As seen in Botticelli's other portraits of aristocratic women (*Portrait of Esmeralda Bandinelli*, c. 1471; *Portrait of a young woman*, c. 1475; *Portrait of a woman*, 1481-1482) and period dress conventions, married women were expected to wear their hair up. As St. Catherine was a virgin, and assumingly Caterina was perceived to be a virgin until her marriage, the fact she is depicted with her hair up lends evidence to the portrait existing after her marriage to Girolamo Riario.

Caterina's non-dress related accessories also speak volumes to the identity she aimed to communicate through this portrait. She holds a handkerchief in her hand alongside the martyr palm, a book sits on the ledge in front of her as she rests her far hand on it, and she clutches at the spiked wheel tucked between her arm and torso in the foreground. The martyr palm, book, and spiked wheel are each iconography of St. Catherine. The book is commonly used as symbolism of knowledge and intellect, personality traits strongly associated with Caterina Sforza. Furthermore, the martyrs palm and spiked wheel are symbolic of strength and fortitude, characteristics also known to be possessed by Caterina Sforza (Stollhans, 2007). However, Stollhans (2007) notes that it was uncommon to see depictions of St. Catherine of Alexandria holding all three items.

Her allegiance with the Riario family put Caterina in joint control of large territories in Romagna, the hilly countryside near Tuscany, and specifically Imola and Forlì. These territories could be depicted in the background of this portrait, as the landscape bears some resemblance to Imola. The representation of her husband's territories in the background of the painting could represent an attempt to draw direct associations with their rule over the land, as at the time Caterina and Girolamo would have resided in Rome (Hairston, 2000). Furthermore, the territories speak to a conveyed identity of status and power which Caterina communicated.

### <span id="page-56-0"></span>**Di Credi Portrait, 1481-1483 (p[.119\)](#page-128-2)**

This portrait by Lorenzo di Credi (1456/59-1537), a pupil of Andrea del Verrocchio (a peer of Leonardo da Vinci), showcases the subtle manner in which he mimicked the styles of his two famous mentors. The faces of di Credi's female portraits are very similar to that of Da Vinci's (Vasari, 1550-1568). So much so that there was much debate surrounding the similarities between Da Vinci's portrait of Ginevra d'Amerigo dei Benci and di Credi's *La Giovane Vedova* (Brewer, 1970). This painting of Caterina showcases di Credi's noted intentionality and care with colors (Brewer, 1970; Vasari, 1550 -1568). Of note is his use of green and greenery in the background of his works, which is especially evident in this portrait with its elaborate landscape. It is likely di Credi's similar style to that of famed artists Da Vinci and Verrocchio is what drew him to be commissioned for this portrait.

This portrait by di Credi could have been painted anytime from 1480 until 1490, after the Botticelli portrait and the death of Girolamo (De Vries, 2010). As such this would be a period in which Caterina and her husband had recently been granted control over Forlì in addition to Girolamo's jurisdiction over Imola (Hairston, 2000; Pasolini, 1913; de Vries, 2010). Additionally, depending on the actual date of this portrait this could be a time after Girolamo's

assassination on April 14, 1488, which subsequently resulted in the kidnapping of Caterina and the rest of her family in Forlì (Hairston, 2000). Paired with the comments she is documented of making in regards to her children's kidnapping on that day, it would appear this was a philosophy she intended publicly convey as she is depicted in the painting sans her children, despite at the time of this portrait potentially having three to seven children at the time, including male heirs whom would aid in demonstrating political dynastic strength (De Vries, 2010). Instead, in this depiction of Caterina she appears to play up other elements of domestic simplicity and power through her dress and background elements.

Caterina is depicted wearing a simple blue gown with a white *camicia*, and a green stomacher. The *camicia* is visible in the distinct slashings on the sleeves of her gown that are held together with lacing. The *camicia* is visible at the neckline and is bursting from the sleeve slashing creates a puffed and voluminous decorative effect to the otherwise unadorned sleeves. Caterina is also depicted wearing a red girdle tied at the center of her waist. Her dress being unadorned and simple would be more akin to aristocratic woman of the early 15th century or dress of a peasant at the time of the painting. Her overall unbefitting dress of her status allows other aspects of the portrait to be of greater focus.

While there are no clear dress signifiers of wealth or status, the jasmine flowers in the bowl on the table in front of Caterina carry clear implications to one element of Caterina's identity she wished to convey. Caterina was known during her time for her skill in alchemy, and jasmine is known for its various healing and alchemical properties (Lifson, 2017). One alternative title to this work *La dama dei gelsomini, conosciuto anche come ritratto di Caterina Sforza*, translates to the *Lady of Jasmine, known as the Portrait of Caterina Sforza*. While typical

symbols of wealth do not appear to concern Caterina in this depiction of herself, intelligence and status manifest themselves in other ways.

The abundance of red in the portrait also hints at the papal protection and support she received as regent over Imola and Forlì following her husband's assassination. Similarly, the Rocca Sforzesca, the fortress in which she resided with Girolamo during their time in Imola, is recognizable in the left background of the portrait. The fortress depicted bares numerous similarities with Rocca Sforzesca. The sharp cut out of the moat connected to the larger moat surrounding the city of Imola can be seen in the background of the painting and in **Error! Reference source not found.**. The presence of the fortress in the background speaks to her political power, power atypical of an aristocratic woman of the period.

The combination of elements within this portrait, the seemingly traditional feminine pursuit of horticulture (in actuality a reference to her atypical alchemical pursuits), the distinct implications of political power, and lack of references to an heir all curate a very particular and exceptionally unique identity in which Caterina Sforza aimed to convey about herself.

### <span id="page-59-0"></span>**Sciorina Portrait, 1585 (p[.121\)](#page-130-0)**

Lorenzo Io Sciorina was commissioned by Francesco I de' Medici (1541-1587) in 1585 to complete this portrait of Caterina and her third husband, Giovanni di Pierfrancesco de' Medici as a part of a series of Medici ancestry portraits between 1584 and 1585 (De Vries, 2010). The artist was not exceptionally popular but identified by Vasari as having artistic promise (Vasari,

1912-1915/1550-1568). He is not widely studied or mentioned in research, museums, or exhibitions due to his obscurity. It can be implied that his lack of popularity can be attributed to being overshadowed by more popular Bronzino pupils such as Alessandro Allori, who was the same age as Sciorina.

As this dual portrait was commissioned long after the deaths of both individuals, scholars believe Sciorina referenced two portraits created during their lifetimes for this commission. Historians theorize that Sciorina took inspiration of his depiction of the late Giovanni from Filippo Lippi's *Adoration of the Magi* which was completed in 1496, two years prior to Giovanni's death. However, there is debate on the origin for inspiration of Caterina. The *Catalogo Generale dei Beni Culturali* describes the inspiration possibly originating from a Francesco Cotignola portrait, as Cotignola was residing in Florence at the time ("Rittratto di Giovanni," n.d.; de Vries, 2010). Opposingly, and most convincingly, de Vries (2010) describes the inspiration for Caterina's depiction originating from Giorgio Vasari's popular portrait of the widow Caterina de' Medici (nee Sforza) which was created between 1556 and 1559 ("Vasari Giorgio, Ritratto," n.d.). As such the garments are not accurate for the period in which they were painted (1585) but is consistent for the periods in which Giovanni and Caterina respectively lived.

Caterina is wearing a black gown with long sleeves that are laced into the armhole and has a black and white lined veil over her head and hair. Caterina's gown appears to be unembellished aside from (Vasari, 1550-1568/1912-1915) the laced-up armhole. She also remains unadorned by jewelry, but carries a white handkerchief, possibly another sign of mourning. Caterina's dress distinctly identifies her as a widow of the upper classes, while she does not have any jewelry to depict her identity, we do know that she is wearing the period

appropriate garments for mourning. However, realistically Caterina would not have worn the dress of a widow as Giovanni was her third husband and depicted "alive" standing next to her in the portrait (de Vries, 2010). As the likeness of Caterina was taken from a portrait created shortly after Giovanni's death, Sciorina clearly did not take into account cultural dress conventions of widows and has depicted Caterina to appear as a devoted wife that is actually dressed like a devoted widow, despite her husband being "alive" in the portrait ("Rittratto di Giovanni," n.d.). Caterina's all black attire could also be intended to indicate her numerous widowhoods, prior to Giovanni's death.

Sciorina utilizes color, light, and body language to great effect within this portrait of Caterina to further characterize her identity as a widow. The paleness of Caterina's face directly contrasts with her stark black mourning clothes, in a way creating a chiaroscuro effect that aids in focusing on her face. Sciorina's attention to Caterina's face and other visible body parts aids in establishing emotionally revealing body language. Caterina is positioned slightly behind her husband, likely to convey the idea of her subserviency to him. Her eyes are angled towards her husband instead of towards the viewer, as was typical of other portraiture of her. Finally, her pale white hand appears to rest over her heart, as if the Sciorina hoped to depict Caterina to appear as if the emotional pain of her husband's "death" was made physical.

This dual portrait of Caterina and Giovanni summarily depicts a version of Caterina Sforza that she spent decades cultivating. The persona of the tragically widowed woman was one that she embraced to great effect throughout her life in an effort to gain social and political advantages, that were described as Machiavellian for the time. While this portrait was created almost eighty years after her death it embodies the legacy she established for herself following the assassination of her first husband. In the dress of a widow Caterina not only depicts grief, but

as seen in this portrait she embodies loyalty and perceived everlasting devotion in her body language towards her husband. These characteristics would have been extremely desirable within the Medici family as her marriage to Giovanni brought together two of the most powerful families in Europe.

### **Bianca Maria Sforza**

<span id="page-62-0"></span>Bianca Maria Sforza was born in April 1472 to the Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza (d. 1476), and Bona of Savoy. Following her father's 1476 assassination, the Milanese dukedom fell to her uncle Ludovico, who took arranged for Bianca to live with him, instead of with her mother. Furthermore, with custody of Bianca, Ludovico gained control of arranging Bianca's future marriages. Ludovico arranged for Bianca to marry Duke Filiberto of Savoy, however, in 1482 he died before the marriage could occur. In 1493, Bianca Maria Sforza married the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I of the Habsburgs. While Bianca brought with her an exceptionally large dowry and ties to the Milanese dukedom, their marriage was not a "successful" one. Maximilian utilized Bianca's large dowry to finance his military conquests, including numerous attempts to take control of Milan. Bianca did not have any children before her early death in 1510 likely of consumption (Rill, 1968).

### <span id="page-62-1"></span>**De' Predis Portrait, 1493 (p[.123\)](#page-132-0)**

Painted by Ambrogio de' Predis (1455-1508) in 1493, this portrait of Bianca Maria Sforza is one of the most famous portraits of the Italian Renaissance. As de' Predis was a Milanese court painter it aligns with his skillset that he depicts Bianca in a similar manner to other Milanese/ Italian court portraits of the time (National Gallery of Art, n.d.b). Furthermore, de' Predis drew inspiration from his mentor Leonardo da Vinci, whose previous portraiture for the Milanese court likely aided de' Predis in securing several commissions of Bianca Maria (The National Gallery, n.d.; National Gallery of Art, n.d.b). This painting was likely created around the time of Bianca's marriage to Emperor Maximilian. According to the National Gallery of Art (n.d.b) de' Predis accompanied Bianca to Innsbruck for her marriage and created several portraits of Bianca and her new husband during this period. Thus, this portrait likely marks the transition of Bianca from a Sforza to a Habsburg, yet her dress identity still marks numerous Sforza allegiances.

In this portrait Bianca is wearing a brocade gold over-gown, a white *camicia* underneath the over-gown, her sleeves feature slashing in which the *camicia* is visible through, and her sleeve is tied into the shoulder seam with black ribbons. The base fabric of Bianca's gown is possibly velvet due to the specific brush marks that indicate a pile weave. Within Bianca's brocade gown there are a number of natural elements including the symbolic motif of pomegranate (there are three of them depicted together on tree stumps in numerous places) and the ogee lattice.

In addition to her garments, Bianca is depicted with an abundance of jewelry and accessories. She is wearing an elaborate headdress with gold floral shaped metal netting embellished with pearls, diamonds, and other gemstones. One cluster of jewels that hangs over her left ear has a piece of cloth wrapped intwined with the group of jewels that says "merito et tempore [With merit and time]" a Sforza family motto [\(Figure 7\)](#page-64-0). The inclusion of her family motto on her headdress is a large visible signifier of her status as part of the Sforza family. Furthermore, the truly abundant jewelry Bianca is wearing in this painting hints at a high level of wealth and status (Meagher, 2007).

**Figure 7. Sforza Family Motto Depicted on Accessory, 1493** From the National Portrait Gallery (US) (1942.9.53), by Ambrogio de' Predis, c. 1493, *Bianca Maria Sforza* (https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.1192.html#inscription)

<span id="page-64-0"></span>The headdress appears to connect to the string of white and grey pearls that wrap around gold fabric that encases her body length ponytail. Bianca also wears a plain black string *ferronière*, possibly in which the grouping of jewels is attached to, which is tied to her head with the excess string hanging down to her left shoulder. Bianca is wearing a white pearl necklace with two jewels (one rectangular and black, and the other orange and circular) hanging off with a large oval pearl at the end which sits on the collar of her dress. Furthermore, she appears to be wearing another black string necklace underneath this more elaborate one, which disappears underneath the neckline of her gown, possibly hinting at a crucifix necklace. Finally, Bianca appears to be wearing a jeweled girdle, which features a pattern of four pearls surrounding a larger rectangular stone imposed on a gold circular mount, with a red carnation flower tucked

into it. The red carnation tucked into Bianca's girdle showcases her identity as a bride, or soon to be bride, as the carnation in Northern Italian art during this period was symbolic for marriage and love (Meagher, 2007).

While Bianca's accessories speak directly to her membership to the Sforza family, her hairstyle and dress speak to a hair and dress tradition popular in the Milanese court during this period. Bianca is depicted with her hair in a wrapped jeweled ponytail, known as a *coazzone* braid, and loosely hanging hair on the side of her face that covers her ear (Welch, 2009). The *coazzone* braid style is possibly an iconic reference to her mother Bona of Savoy and her aunt Beatrice d'Este, who is credited for bringing the style to Milan, both women were depicted in numerous other portraits with the same *coazzone* braid hair style. Her aunt was notably depicted in this style in the *Sant' Ambrogio ad Nemus altarpiece* in the Pala Sforzesca in 1494 which depicts Bianca's uncle's investiture as regent over the dukedom of Milan following her father's assassination (Welch, 2009).

As this portrait likely marks the transition of Bianca from a Sforza to a Habsburg her dress identity still marks numerous Sforza allegiances. The Sforza family motto ("Merito et tempore [Merit of time]") inclusion on her *ferronière* could be indicative of Bianca's hopes for her new marriage, in addition to her remaining loyalty to the Sforza family and their values. Similarly, other elements of her dress indicate Bianca's possible hopes and dreams for her second marriage.

The inclusion of the red carnation tucked into her girdle is an example of overt period symbolism, as during the Renaissance the inclusion of carnations in Northern Italian Renaissance art referred to love and marriage (Meagher, 2007). Additionally, Bianca's brocade gown includes a series of motifs featuring three pomegranates on tree stumps. The pomegranates featured on the

sleeve of her garment and across her chest, partially visible in profile, are likely to imply Bianca's desire to be very fertile and/ or live a very long life in her marriage (Fanelli, 1994). As this was Bianca's second marriage, her first having left her a widow by the age of 10, the now 21-year-old Bianca, and period cultural norms, would expect her to provide her husband with children (Rill, 1968). This work is exceptionally relevant to Bianca's dress identity in portraiture throughout her marriage to Emperor Maximilian I. The Strigel portraits from several years later depict Bianca having adopted a style of dress that further aligns with Habsburg court styles and those expected of the Empress. Furthermore, following the completion of this painting and her marriage and political ties between Milan and the Holy Roman Empire became strained as Maximillian I repeatedly attempted to control her uncle's territories (Rill, 1968). As such this painting in many ways could represent the last exertion of Bianca's Italian/ Milanese and Sforza identity.

### <span id="page-66-0"></span>**De' Predis Portrait, 1493-1495 (p[.124\)](#page-133-0)**

This de' Predis portrait was created in proximity to the previous de' Predis portrait yet conveys a slightly more subdued depiction of Bianca. At the time of the painting of this portrait, Bianca was likely within two years of her marriage to Maximillian I. However, Bianca and Maximillian did not live together until 1494. Considering that Bianca's dowry was utilized to fund her husband's military exploits in the first two years of their marriage and the fact that the couple lived apart, one can conclude that in the eyes of Maximillian, Bianca served her purpose, providing an enormous influx in wealth to him, and was allowed to live and dress as she pleased (Rill, 1968).

Bianca is wearing an embroidered broad square necklined gown with slashed sleeves attached using black ribbons. Her gown is a blue-green color, with her white *camicia* visible at

the armhole. Her sleeve is a burnt gold color that matches closely to the brocade trim around her neckline. The bodice of Bianca's gown appears to be a textile with lustrous properties, such as a silk taffeta. De' Predis conveys this textile characteristic utilizing the light source to show the way light moves across the fabric. Bianca's *camicia* is likely made of a fine linen, which would be consistent with the period and her socio-economic status.

De' Predis emphasized Bianca's vast wealth in this portrait by overtly depicting her in an abundance of jewelry. She is wearing two necklaces, one long string of pearls that is doubled around her neck and the other a gold pendant necklace. The pendant is in an ogee shape with four silver crosses and three pearls attached to the bottom of the pendant. On her head Bianca wears a black bead *ferronière* with a gold pendant attached to it. The pendant on the *ferronière* has a square ruby in the center, a small black jewel attached to the top, and a large teardrop shaped pearl hanging from the bottom of the pendant. Bianca's hair appears to be in some form of snood that is gold with a brocade edging, the snood appears to split down her ponytail and then becomes silver in color. It is possible that this is a personal take of the popular Milanese *coazzone* braid.

While likely residing within a Habsburg palace at the time of this painting, Bianca is depicted bearing many similarities and differences from de' Predis's 1493 portrait of her. Similar to the 1493 portrait, Bianca is clear depicted as favoring the dress traditions of her birthplace, despite also acclimating to her husband's court attire. This portrait depicts her in notably less jewelry and less ornamented garments than the earlier portrait, which could be indicative of this portrait showcasing Bianca in dress closer to that she would have worn every day or within Austro-German social circles where an abundance of wealth displays were less favored. While the 1493 painting depicts the Sforza family motto, this painting notably does not have any Sforza symbolism, possibly indicating a severing of ties with her family in Milan in favor of her husband. Furthermore, the lack of contact with her husband at this point and her pending investiture as Empress, could explain the lack of Habsburg symbolism in her dress identity, as legally she was part of the Habsburg family, however she lived apart from her husband and as such likely maintained some amount of dress autonomy (Rill, 1968).

### <span id="page-68-0"></span>**Strigel Portrait (The Metropolitan Museum of Art), 1505-1510**

Commissioned in 1505, this portrait by German artist Bernhard Strigel (1460-1528) portrays a very different woman than the de' Predis paintings commissioned at the start of her marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor. Strigel was noted as having been influenced by a number of other higher profile south German artists of the period including Albrecht Dürer and Hans Strigel (Thyssen-Bornemisza Museo, n.d.). As Strigel was so ingrained and influenced by the German art style, the commissioning of this painting likely was meant to not only showcase Bianca's assimilation into the Austro-German culture of the Habsburgs, but of her relinquishing of all things Italian, including art and dress.

Bianca wears a red gown with gold trim and a *camicia* underneath it with layered sleeves (one fitted and one extremely flowing). There is elaborate embroidery and brocade on the bodice which stops slightly below the empire line. The dramatically large and voluminous sleeves are partially covered with a gold embroidery that resembles flames creeping up her arms. Across the bodice of her dress appear to be two embroidered peacocks with a scene of four individuals surrounded by flying birds below it, potentially an allegorical religious scene.

She appears to be wearing pink fitted gloves with top stitching at the thumb seam. She has three rings on her ungloved hand, similar to the other Strigel portrait. Bianca is wearing five necklaces: two large circular chain linked necklaces, two braided necklaces, one with a knot on

her collarbone, and one large circular chain linked necklace styled as a choker. Her headdress appears to be made of braid with jewels along the front. One can infer that the inclusion of peacocks and the flame-like motifs are meant to signify strong royal/ aristocratic rule or lineage. The styles she is wearing align with those worn in Northern Europe during the period, and a nod to the latent fashion advances present in Northern Europe at a time that marked the High Renaissance in the Italian peninsula and arguably the beginning of the Northern Renaissance.

Color plays dominantly within this composition with numerous possible purposes. The abundance of red in the composition allows the viewer's eyes to focus on Bianca. A possible intention of her bedecked in red could also be for its associations with the Catholic Church and symbolic allegiances to the Pope. This would have been very important for Bianca to convey as her husband and her positions as Emperor and Empress of the Holy Roman Empire rested on allegiance and support from and to the Pope. The red knot within the garments Bianca is wearing, the red velvet she sits on and the red trim of the tapestry, create a balance of color within the composition and subtly draw the eyes back to the more prominent and rich red hues Bianca is wearing.

By the time this portrait was painted it was between 1 and 5 years before Bianca's premature death, and Bianca was still, and would remain childless (Rill, 1968). This knowledge appears to affirm certain rationale behind the specific dress identity Bianca aimed to create in this portrait. In this depiction of Bianca her dress and body conceal several of her feminine body parts which were typically associated with fertility. As Bianca was several years into her marriage and still childless at the time of this portrait, she seems to be conveying a dress identity that is for her own benefit, instead of the benefit of her position as empress. Her bust is disguised with an unknown narrative scene, her stomach/womb is hidden under yards of fabric from her

sleeves, and yet her dainty hands are revealed with their bright pink gloves to remind the viewer of her position as an aristocratic lady twice over as an empress and daughter to a duke. This is further solidified by the inclusion of numerous elements of jewelry such as the chained choker that includes the pure and regal pearls. However, the dual meaning of pearls, as a wealth and purity signifier and as the jewel of the patron saint of childbirth, St. Margaret of Antioch, could imply that Bianca still held some hope of bearing her husband an heir (Raber, 2011).

### <span id="page-70-0"></span>**Strigel Portrait (Kunshistorisches Museum Wien), 1505-1510 (p[.122\)](#page-131-1)**

This portrait, also by Strigel, bears several similarities to the previous Strigel portrait. While both portraits' compositions are almost identical, there are various notable differences. This portrait has more overt iconography indicative of Bianca's status and position. Furthermore, this depiction of Bianca has more emphasis on the entirety of her body, specifically her bust, stomach/ womb, and arms, possibly an earlier attempt at the previous more symbolically reserved portrait. The differences between these two portraits hint at a shifting idea of how Bianca wanted or needed to be portrayed. The previous portrait specifically hints more to the Bianca's own possible preferences, however both portraits utilize dress and artistic liberties to hide her true age and health.

Bianca wears a gown with sleeves that feature large gaps which you can see the *camicia*  underneath it. This 16th century gown represents the spread of Italian dress styles to Northern Europe during this period, as sleeve slashings on women's dress was previously popular on the Italian peninsula (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). A depiction of a noble German woman during the Renaissance within the *Trachtenbuch* (**Error! Reference source not found.**) (the inscription reads: "The noble German clothing was like this several years ago") illustrates a style of dress almost identical to that of Bianca within this portrait. Furthering the inclusion of dress objects

influenced by trade, Bianca is also depicted wearing a turban-like headpiece, known as a zazara, that was common on the Italian peninsula during the period (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015; Cockram, 2013). Similar to the previous Strigel portrait, Bianca is depicted wearing one glove, while the other is held in her hand with her arms crossed. Gloves held incredible value during this period and are one of the many overt communications of her wealth and status as a highranking lady in Northern Europe (Raber, 2011).

**Figure 8.** *Trachtenbuch***, 1530-1540, 222-224***.* From the collection of the Germanisches National Museum (HS 22474), by Christopher Weiditz, 1530/1540*, Trachtenbuch*, (http://dlib.gnm.de/item/Hs22474/224)

<span id="page-71-0"></span>The intricacies of Bianca's dress in this portrait are based on a complex style and lavish textiles befitting of her status. The ground fabric of her gown appears to be a pile weave, possibly velvet as it was common during this period and would create the same shine on the

surface as seen in this portrait or an ornate boucle. It is also likely that the *camicia* she wears beneath her gown is made of a silk or linen weave.

Bianca's dress is heavily embellished and accessorized. Her gown is made of a burnt gold/ bronze like color with black embroidery. The embroidery mostly features on her bodice and zazara cap and appear to look like embroidered leaves. There are several red and gold tied ribbons of various sizes, star shaped slashings on the sleeves, and the letters "M" and "B" embroidered on the neckline, M and B likely for Maximilian and Bianca. Furthermore, there is an embroidered crown on the neckline of her gown directly above her and her husband's initials. Similarly, there are golden thread bows embroidered into Bianca's zazara.

She is also depicted in an abundance of jewelry, an amount as that would be befitting the new level of wealth she acquired as Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. Bianca is depicted wearing seven necklaces: two of double strands of pearls and braided gold chain, three of decorated gold chains, and one plain black string likely attached to a crucifix (theses four necklaces are tucked into her bodice), and one choker made of gold flowers with a large rectangular jewel, possibly a ruby, with a large pearl and emerald attached to it. She also is wearing three rings on her ungloved hand, and a gold brooch with a large pearl attached is dangling from her zazara.

The combination of Bianca's extravagant dress and the knowledge of the state of her marriage during this period appear to affirm certain rationale behind the specific dress identity Bianca aimed to create. It would be advantageous for the childless empress to depict herself in an abundance of jewels and the finest gowns, as a reminder to those at court of her position. Despite her and her husband's distant relationship he still held a presence in her portraiture as evidenced by his first initial appearing on her collar below a crown. The inclusion of her husband's initials

in her dress identity does not reflect the social tensions of the time as her uncle, now Duke of Milan and her husband were not on good terms. Furthermore, having in previous years utilized her position to provide aid to Sforza troops against the French, Bianca was notably not an admirer of her uncle Ludovico (Rill, 1968). As such, the inclusion of her husband's initials in her gown and he Austro-German dress style, when compared with her earlier portraiture in which she wore Milanese styles and the Sforza family motto, speaks directly to her personal feelings, the familial and politic tensions of both families, and the inclination to pay homage to the stronger political power of the Holy Roman Empire. The fact that she is depicted with her hand placed near her stomach could also be indicative of the hope she still had to produce an heir, or a child at all.

### **Cecilia Gallerani**

<span id="page-73-0"></span>Cecilia Gallerani was the mistress of Duke Ludovico Sforza (il Moro) (1452-1508) prior to his marriage to Beatrice d'Este (Dec & Wałek, n.d.). Following her father's early death, her elder brothers arranged a marriage between herself and Giovanni Stefano Visconti, another notable, wealthy, and non-noble family in Italy at the time. The two were wed "pro verba", when Cecilia was twelve, however they never consummated their marriage. In 1487, the marriage was dissolved because of the lack of consummation. Around 1489 Cecilia, aged 16, became mistress of Ludovico, aged 37, despite having no noble blood or standing in court prior to their affair. Ludovico married Beatrice d'Este in 1491, and continued to conduct his relationship with Cecilia in private. In 1491, following Ludovico's marriage, Cecilia gave birth to Ludovico's first son, Cesare Sforza Visconti. Ludovico was unable to legitimize his son with Cecilia, however his birth was celebrated, and Cecilia and the boy were given the surname Visconti in reference to the

ducal family (which proved ironic considering her previous engagement and pro verba marriage to Giovanni Visconti) (Shell & Sironi, 1992).

In an effort to provide Cecilia a position at court outside of Ludovico's mistress, and in order to appease Beatrice, Cecilia was married to Count Lodovic Carminati de Brambilla in 1492 (Shell & Sironi, 1992). She was noted for her intelligence, having been well educated, and beauty while at the Milanese court, and was widely popular even after her affair with Ludovico Sforza ended in 1492. Cecilia remained at court with her husband until Duke Sforza was deposed in 1499 when she sought refuge with Isabella d'Este. She would go on to spend the rest of her life between Milan and her husband's estate hosting salons and being a muse to several artists and poets, until her death in 1536 (Shell & Sironi, 1992; Dec & Wałek, n.d.).

### <span id="page-74-0"></span>**Da Vinci Portrait, 1490 (p[.125\)](#page-134-0)**

As Leonardo Da Vinci was brought to Milan in 1482 by Ludovico Sforza, it can be assumed at this point Da Vinci's work in Florence had garnered interest throughout the Italian peninsula. Da Vinci is credited for ushering in the High Renaissance with his Milanese creation *The Last Supper I (*c. 1495-97). Da Vinci's works were also noted for his use of smooth colors that comfort the eyes in addition to his scholarly use of form (Wundram, 2016). His dedication to color and form is evident in this painting in addition to his rigorous study of anatomy, all of which aided in this realistic depiction of Cecilia. This is evidenced in the visible bones and muscles in Cecilia's hand that holds the ermine. Da Vinci, noted for his thousands of anatomy sketches, aptly captures the movement in her hand as it struggles to hold the ermine still, despite the lack of movement elsewhere in her body. Da Vinci's renown and level of detail in his depictions of the human body would have made him a strong candidate for a commission of Ludovico's beloved Cecilia (Dec & Wałek, n.d.; Vasari, 1912-1915/1550-1568).

As one of Leonardo Da Vinci's numerous recorded muses, this portrait of Cecilia contains a number of contextual subtexts. During the time that this painting was created Cecilia was likely pregnant with her first child by Ludovico, Cesare Sforza Visconti (Dec & Wałek, n.d.). As Ludovico was married to Beatrice d'Este shortly after this painting was created, this portrait was possibly a last public articulation of Ludovico's love for her as the affair was conducted more discretely out of respect to Beatrice upon her arrival at court, and in 1492 Cecilia was wed to Count Lodovic Carminati de Brambilla (Shell & Sironi, 1992). Da Vinci was an apt choice of artist if this was the intention behind the painting as he was noted for his poetic painting style which easily conveyed a range of emotions, including love (Wundram, 2016).

Cecilia's gaze is aimed lovingly at something or someone to her right as she holds the ermine close to her heart. The ermine itself is representative of Cecilia's lover the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, who two years prior to the painting of this portrait had received the Order of Ermine from the King of Naples. Sforza was subsequently known as *Ermellino Bianco* ("white ermine"). The presences of the ermine links Cecilia directly to the duke. The ermine also has historic symbolism of purity and beauty, which proves ironic as Cecilia was Ludovico's mistress (Dec & Wałek, n.d.).

Cecilia's dress within the portrait also carries a similar level of symbolism. Cecilia wears a blue mantle over one arm with gold trim arm hole in which her gown sleeve is visible. This style is visually similar to depictions of the Madonna in Italian Renaissance art, as she is frequently depicted in a blue mantle. She wears an orange gown with sleeves tied into the armhole, visible on left shoulder, and laced together slashings at the elbow in which the camicia is visible and puffs through. The square neckline of her gown is embroidered with geometric

swirls that are mimicked in the vertical trim along the princess seam line and the cuffs and edges of her slashed gown sleeves.

Cecilia wears a long black beaded necklace that is double around her neck, a plain black *ferronière* across her upper forehead, and a gold scalloped *ferronière* across her brow that is tucked underneath her hair. The *ferronière* was a type of head accessory typically seen on aristocratic women, therefore it can be perceived as a signifier of rank in addition to other forms of dress depicted in this painting. Cecilia is depicted wearing two *ferronière*, and the manner in which her hair is styled lends to her wearing a *coazzone* braid. Her hair is parted down the middle, she has her hair in two side pieces that fall along her face, and there appears to be some form of ponytail/braid visible down her neck. This hair style would be very consistent with dress at the Milanese court during this period (Welch, 2009).

Cecilia's calm and at ease pose and demeanor in this portrait hint at her seemingly carefree and peaceful lifestyle. As this portrait depicts her prior to Ludovico's marriage, and Beatrice's arrival at court, Cecilia lived a lavish and carefree life as the mistress of one of the most powerful dukes in Europe. Her status and comfort would have been compounded had she been pregnant at the time of this portrait in addition to being a muse to one of the greatest artists of the period. Cecilia appears to convey her embracement of Milanese court life and the luxuries it brought to her position.

### **Giulia Farnese**

<span id="page-76-0"></span>Giulia Farnese was born into the noble Farnese family in 1474. In May of 1489, Giulia married Orsino Orsini and spent much of the early years of her marriage in her mother-in-law's household in Rome (Fresu, 2019). Giulia would go on to become the mistress of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (1431-1503) at the age of 16 years old. Then two years later, in 1492, Borgia

was elected to the papacy and became Pope Alexander VI, making Giulia the first open mistress of a pope. Throughout Giulia's relationship with the Pope, she lived in the Vatican alongside his daughter, Lucrezia. Giulia is believed to have birthed the Pope a daughter (although the girl's parentage is disputed) in 1492, further solidifying her position in the eyes of the Catholic people as "concubine of the Pope" (p. 96) as described by Johan Burchard, the Pope's master of ceremonies (Strathern, 2019). The Pope's highly visible relationship with Giulia was part of the beginning of Borgia and papacy's reputation and association with depravity. However, despite this less than admirable association, through Giulia's relationship with the Pope she attained a cardinal position for her brother Alessandro, who would go on to become Pope Paul III in 1534 (Strathern, 2019).

### <span id="page-77-0"></span>**Longhi Portrait, 1535-1540 (p[.126\)](#page-135-1)**

Luca de' Longhi (1507-1580) of Ravenna was noted by Vasari for his "very beautiful panel-pictures in oils and portraits from nature" (p. 154) (Trerè, n.d.). Longhi was further noted for his immense skill accumulated from the study of prints of other Renaissance master's works. However, Longhi's reputation and lack of international renown was limited as he was known for not frequently leaving Ravenna (Trerè, n.d.). As such this painting, which now hangs in the Castel Sant'Angelo was likely commissioned by Pope Paul III, younger brother of Giulia, not long after his ascension to the papacy in 1534, which would explain Longhi's willingness to leave Ravenna (Strathern, 2019). It is possible that such a portrait would be commissioned to restructure Giulia's public image as another Farnese entered the Vatican. However, the portrait, as it were, would have been created at least 11 years after her death.

Giulia is depicted wearing a silver/white brocade long mantle that is draped over her far shoulder. She is also wearing a pink natural waist belted outer-gown with sleeves to her elbow.

Her under-gown is blue featuring slashings held together by plain gold aiguillettes. Through the slashing is the plain white *camicia* visible underneath her under-gown. The mantle that Giulia is wearing is likely a silk brocade. The white/silver color of the mantle is notable as these colors are associated with purity and virtue. Giulia wears a striking pastel pink over-gown in the otherwise neutral colored composition.

Giulia wears a string of pearls worn in the *ferronière* style, notably worn by aristocratic women in Northern Italian city-states and territories during Giulia's lifetime. The presence of pearls in Giulia's hair and the elegant brocade seen on the mantle are the only overt signifiers of Giulia's rank in society as an upper-class woman as these two elements of dress would be financially restricted to those of the upper social classes. The other garments the Giulia wears are more consistent with period depictions of The Madonna in other allegorical/ biblical scenes.

The Madonna is typically portrayed in a simple gown with a mantle, as seen in Longhi's 1573 painting *The Holy Family with Saint Ann and the Infant Saint John the Baptist* and his 1525-1549 *The Madonna and Child with the Infant John the Baptist in a Landscape*. However, the aiguilettes and sleeve slashing are contemporary stylistic additions to the composition that reflect Italian Renaissance dress elements. The string of pearls worn in Giulia's hair also hint towards contemporary style elements, as The Madonna is frequently depicted in Renaissance portraiture with her head veiled and/or with a halo above her head.

Finally, the fact that Giulia is depicted with her hair up indicates a departure from the typical allegorical/ biblical depictions of The Madonna as throughout the Renaissance and early modern Europe hair being worn braided or in an up-do was an indication of a woman's marital status (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). The clothing Giulia wears is intended to conceal her body and in conjunction her modesty. Only her hands, neck, and face are visible, however Longhi

creates the illusion of a more subtle modesty as he drapes her in voluminous fabrics that aid in concealing her body.

While Giulia's body and dress feature prominently in this composition, the unicorn alongside Giulia also bears significant meaning. It is believed the unicorn is symbolic of Giulia Farnese's family emblem, which included a unicorn. Furthermore, the unicorn is symbolic of purity. In medieval bestiaries, the unicorn was explained to only be lured out using a virgin, which would later connect to the association of The Madonna with the taming of the unicorn in later versions of the Bible (Perez, 2018). This allegorical scene also places emphasis on possibly rewriting Giulia's previous negative associations with Pope Alexander (Perez, 2018).

The choice to depict Giulia as emulating The Madonna alongside the unicorn is consistent with the shift of feminine ideas of virtue and humbleness that sprung up within the Christian community at the beginning of the 16th century. With the numerous branches of Christianity emerging as alternatives to the perceived corruption of the Catholic Church at the end of the 15th century, it would be advantageous to depict the previous mistress of the Pope as reformed and chaste, similar to the Madonna.

### **Isabella d'Este**

<span id="page-79-0"></span>Isabella d'Este was born in May 1474 to Duke Ercole d'Este (1431-1505) and Duchess Eleonora of Aragon (1450-1493). In 1490, she married Francesco Gonzaga (1466-1519), the fourth Marchese of Mantua. Notably, her younger sister Beatrice married Lodovico Sforza, who was the lover of Cecilia Gallerani, the subject of Da Vinci's *Lady with the Ermine* painting (Isabella asked to borrow the painting c. 1491 and Cecilia had it sent to Mantua for several months). Throughout her reign, as both a D'Este and Gonzaga, Isabella frequently travelled to different courts in Italy, and fostered an interest and patronage in the arts (Cockram, 2013).

Isabella had birthed a daughter in 1493, Leonora and another daughter in 1496, Margherita (who would die several months later). However, by 1500 Isabella had given birth to a son Federico II. Despite the early struggles of providing a legitimate male heir, Francesco and Isabella were documented to have had a happy marriage and home. The happy marriage could also be owed in part to the fact that the D' Este family was a more high-profile aristocratic family, with Isabella's mother having royal blood, which would lend further legitimacy and importance to the Gonzaga dynasty (Cockram, 2013; Betussi, 1545). This could in part be an explanation for the freedom in which Isabella experienced in her marriage, freedom to travel, freedom in spending, and most importantly her freedom to govern in her husband's absence, and at his side when present (Cockram, 2013).

Isabella was most well known for her widespread art patronage and her influence on Italian fashion during this period. She most notably popularized the zazara headdress style in addition to voluminous baragoni sleeves (Cockram, 2013; Clayton & Whitaker, 2007). Betussi (1545) described Isabella as exceptionally generous, a gifted ruler, and adored by many during her time. Isabella outlived her husband (d. 1519) by over two decades, and died in Rome in 1539 (James, 2012; Betussi, 1545).

### <span id="page-80-0"></span>**Da Vinci Portrait, 1499-1500 (p[.129\)](#page-138-0)**

Leonardo Da Vinci, a favorite court painter of Northern Italian courts such as at the court of Isabella and her husband, was likely acquired for this commission in response to Isabella's viewing of the *Lady with an Ermine* (1490) at her sister's court in Milan (Cockram, 2013). This portrait, while bearing some compositional similarities to Da Vinci's *Lady with an Ermine*  (1490) and the *Mona Lisa* (1502-1516), is evidently a preliminary sketch. Da Vinci most notably utilized sketching and his understanding of anatomy to develop his art (Vasari, 1550-1568/1912-

1915).The level of detail still visible in the sketch speaks to Da Vinci's talent and attention to detail in his rendering of Isabella.

Isabella is depicted in an extremely wide necked gown with blue stripes and voluminous sleeves that are gathered into the armscye. In detailed images there is evidence of ribbons near the armscye which would have been used to tie the sleeve into the bodice's armscye. She also appears to be wearing a white *camicia* underneath her gown that is visible at the neckline. The wide neckline and exposed *camicia* are slightly ahead of their time in terms of style, as the wide neck and exposed *camicia* did not gain widespread popularity until the first part of the 16th century (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). Isabella is also illustrated with the faint beginnings of an elaborate *ferronière* on her head. The *ferronière* is consistent with the period, especially considering Isabella's sister, Beatrice d' Este, resided in Milan where the style was initially popularized.

As this is intended to be compositional or preliminary sketch of a never completed portrait, the textiles are not rendered in this drawing. However, notably Da Vinci includes pastel coloring in this sketch. The *camicia* appears to be white with gold vertical stripes and a gold band across the top and her gown is blue with blue vertical stripes. The edge of Isabella's *camicia* appears to feature some sort of embroidery or braided looping attached to the gold band. The gold stripes of the *camicia* are likely a form of embellishment or embroidery

By the time of this portrait, Isabella had yet to birth her husband a male heir, which could likely be indicative of why the portrait lacks many of the period symbolism of dutiful and successful aristocratic wives (i.e., emphasis on fertility symbolism such as the pomegranate motif, etc.). The lack of adornment and gown style that is slightly ahead of its time are

significant to the analysis of Isabella's conveyed identity and could speak to Isabella's more authentic personal identity in private.

### <span id="page-82-0"></span>**Titian Portrait, 1534-1536 (p[.127\)](#page-136-1)**

This portrait of Isabella by noted High Renaissance artist Tiziano "Titian" Vecellio (1490-1576) embodies many of his talents. Titian was noted for his depiction of numerous powerful individuals throughout his lifetime including Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Queen Isabella of Portugal, and Philip II to name a few (Goldfarb, Freedberg, & Mena Marqués, 1998; Wundram, 2016). Titian studied under Giovanni Bellini, who was similarly contracted by Isabella's son Federico Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua to complete several commissions (Bensusan, 2013). In addition, to Titian's high profile portraiture patrons, he was noted for his landscapes, religious images, and allegorical paintings, with his use of color being the most prominent feature, going on to inspire artists like Manet due to his rich and varied use of colors, unseen in other High Renaissance works. He was noted for his use of color transcending his use of color, allowing for figures to blend together. In a way this is seen with the manner in which the ermine stole blends with the outer-gown, and the outer-gown blends with the background (Wundram, 2016). Vasari (1550-1568/1912-1915) notes Titian's skill at rendering flesh and hair, evidenced in Isabella's face (despite having to work from an older portrait) and the strands of hair on the ermine stole.

In direct contrast to the Da Vinci portrait, this portrait depicts Isabella in all the regal dress elements befitting her status. This portrait notably depicts Isabella in her teens to twenties, possibly to preserve the youthful characterization of Isabella that had such an impact on arts, fashion, and culture at the height of her reign with her husband. This is in contrast to the real Isabella at the time of this portrait who would have been a widow for a little over a decade and

been between the ages of 60 and 62. Some scholars believe that this portrait was copied or inspired by a portrait of Isabella commissioned when she was younger, as by this time she refused to sit for any paintings that would feature her advanced age (Bensusan, 2013; Clayton & Whitaker, 2007). In this, one can assume that this portrait is a highly specific curation of the identity Isabella wished to convey to the public, and a striking contrast to Titian's tradition of realism.

Isabella is depicted wearing a black gown with a low-cut square neckline, in which her white *camicia* is visible. Her camicia has a long white collar with embroidered dark green ribbon which drapes over her chest. The sleeves of her outer-gown are black constructed in the baragoni style. Isabella's under-gown is visible only at the sleeves, which are green and brocade or embroidered, in which a slightly fitted style is present. Her camicia is also visible poking out the cuffs of her under-gown sleeves. Her camicia features blackwork at the sleeve cuffs and collar and has gold embroidered ribbon trims attached on the tie collar and the body of the *camicia*. Her under-gown is embroidered at the sleeves, while any surface texture or embellishment on her outer-gown is indistinguishable due to the condition of the painting. The pattern on her undergown sleeves, known as the *fantasie dei vinci* ("fantasies of the win") was said to be invented by Niccolò di Correggio for Isabella and her sister Beatrice (Clayton & Whitaker, 2007).

Accessories feature prominently in this composition as status markers. Isabella wears a white ermine stole draped over her right shoulder, diamond pearl drop shaped earrings, and a zazara with a gold brooch pinned to the center front. The headdress features green and gold ribbons braided into the back, and an overall off-white color. The brooch includes a black square gem in the center with eight white pearls surrounding it. Isabella appears to be holding some form of jewelry in her left hand, likely a rosary. The presence of the long ermine stole speaks to

Isabella's wealth, as this specific type of fur was exceptionally expensive and rare. Furthermore, the extensive brocade and embroidery on her under-gown sleeves also speak to a level of exceptional wealth. This paired with the large, jeweled brooch on her headdress all point towards the type of wealth displayed in dress that was likely typical throughout Isabella's life.

This portrait, while featuring the face of Isabella most likely around 1500, contrastingly features garments and dress styles of the 1530s, indicating that while Titian was likely instructed by Isabella to base her face on a previous portrait, he took inspiration for her dress from her dress identity of the 1530s (Bensusan, 2013; Clayton & Whitaker, 2007). Isabella wrote in a letter commenting on this portrait that " we doubt whether, at the age at which he [Titian] represents us, we were as beautiful as the picture," (p. 136) implying that the alteration in her age was not the only liberty in which she asked Titian to take with her appearance (Clayton & Whitaker, 2007). This is an especially poignant point as by the time of this portrait the 60- to 62-year-old Isabella's husband Francesco had been dead 15 to 17 years (d. 1519) (Cockram, 2013). As such while Isabella is depicted in a black outer-gown she appears to be asserting her identity outside of widowhood through the evidence of color on her under-gown sleeves, the ermine stole, and her staple zazara. This would be pivotal as several years prior to this painting's commission her son had been made the 1st Duke of Mantua.

Throughout her marriage to Francesco, she had established her own independent identity as a marchioness, known for her international influence on fashion, art, and politics (Cockram, 2013). This portrait makes evident that despite losing her position as a marchioness following her husband's death in 1519, she remained a beacon for fashion, style, and beauty at the court of Mantua, even if that meant having her likeness presented in current fashions with her immortally youthful face, despite her actual age.

### <span id="page-85-0"></span>**Rubens Portrait, 1600-1601 (p[.128\)](#page-137-0)**

While in Italy Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) worked at the court of Mantua under the Duke of Mantua, Vincenzo Gonzaga, great-grandson of Isabella, between 1600 and 1603, where it is likely that he was exposed to the original, now lost, Titian painting of Isabella that this portrait is based on (Goldfarb, Freedberg, & Mena Marqués, 1998; Varshavskaia & Egorova, 2013). Rubens years within the Mantua court likely influenced his choice to depict the late Isabella d'Este (Varshavskaia & Egorova, 2013). Furthermore, Rubens has been noted for his inability to truly depict women in a beautiful manner akin to that of masters such as Botticelli or Bronzino. This aligns with his depiction of Isabella as she appears healthy and objectively good looking, when compared to other portraits of her in which her beauty is not as clearly defined. Rubens was also noted for his depiction of numerous high profile and influential women of his time, as such the selection to re-depict Isabella, one of the most notable Italian art patrons of her time, would have been justified (Lyon, 2018).

According to the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna (n.d.) this copy of the lost Titian painting depicts a younger version of Isabella from the original Titian painting which depicted Isabella at about age 50. If this is assumed to be true that would place the Titian painting of Isabella at circa 1524, almost a decade after the previous analyzed *Titian portrait (1534-1536)*. At this point her husband Francesco had been dead for five years, upon which her eldest son, Federico took up the position of Marquis of Mantua. With this and the knowledge that throughout her marriage to Francesco there was an emphasis on the lives of their children, even the last part of her marriage in which Francesco and her appeared to be at odds, one can assume that this was a period in which Isabella embraced her role as the matriarch (Cockram, 2013).

Isabella's dress reflects her new dowager and matriarchal status. She is wearing a red gown with a very wide rounded neckline in which her white *camicia* is visible with a v-shaped opening at the center that tucks back into the red gown and is not too revealing. The sleeves of the red gown are in the baragoni style. The lower half of the gown sleeves are encircled with a gold ribbon, and the cuffs of the sleeves are trimmed in brown fur. The waist of the gown is emphasized through the straight waistline and pleats. Her *camicia* is embellished with embroidered gold ribbons and pearls.

Isabella's accessories are like those within the *Titian portrait (1534-1536)* as she is wearing an elaborate zazara featuring gold braid and a brooch in the center featuring pearls, a ruby, and another undefined jewel type. She is also wearing a long string of pearls around her neck that falls past her breast. She wears a gold braided girdle around her waist with a black beaded rosary hanging from the center front. Finally, she is wearing a gold ring on her left index finger with a black stone in the center.

Ruben's depiction of Isabella herself may be considered inconsistent with both Renaissance and Baroque ideas of beauty, but it is in line with his notable inability to convey beauty in a manner similar to his predecessors such as Botticelli and Bronzino (Lyon, 2018). However, the manner of dress and accessories that Isabella is depicted in showcase a shift in 16th century Italian dress for women. This strikingly low and wide neckline of her gown showcase and highlight her *camicia* covered breasts and chest in a manner unique to the early 16th century. Similarly, the zazara that she wears is indicative of expanding trade routes between Italy in the Middle East in which the headdress design gained its inspiration. Furthermore, Isabella is notably depicted in opposition of other notable widows of the period, and not depicted in black. This could possibly be a sign of the equality seen within her marriage to Francesco. As the two

co-ruled throughout their marriage and Isabella was given many responsibilities of state, it is possible she did not feel that she needed to continue to wear the garb of a widow after about five years after Francesco's death (Cockram, 2013; James, 2012).

### **Lucrezia Borgia**

<span id="page-87-0"></span>Born in Rome in 1480 to Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia and his mistress Vannozza Cattanei (1442-1518), Lucrezia Borgia was only twelve years old when her father became Pope Alexander VI in 1492. Pope Alexander VI was infamous for his corruption, lack of purity, and desire to use the papacy to serve his own self interests. Many of his actions, with the aid of Lucrezia and his son Cesare Borgia, while being pope directly contributed to the perception of the corruption of the Catholic Church and eventually the Reformation (Bradford, 2004).

Throughout her young adult years under her father's papacy Lucrezia amassed a reputation as a political tool of her father, to be wielded through proposed marriage alliances. However, this reputation was soured after the sudden enforced divorce from her first husband Giovanni Sforza (1466-1510), under the grounds that Sforza was impotent, following their 1493 marriage, the murder of a suspected lover of Lucrezia's in 1498, her quick marriage to Alfonso d'Aragona the same year and his subsequent early death in 1500, and eventually her last and most successful marriage to Alfonso d'Este. This reputation amongst the aristocracy of the Italian city states and aristocracy partnered with her father's infamous and brutal reputation as pope could signal a desire to detach herself from her youthful identity in her later years. In 1519, Lucrezia died at the age of 39 (Bradford, 2004).

### <span id="page-87-1"></span>**Dossi Portrait, 1519-1530 (p[.130\)](#page-139-0)**

Battista Dossi (1490-1548), brother of Dosso Dossi (1486-1542), created this portrait of Lucrezia Borgia between 1519 and 1530. Dossi was a noted court painter in Ferrara, Lucrezia's

marital home, throughout the early 16th century (Hagen & Hagen, 2016; Humfrey & Lucco, 1998). Humfrey and Lucco (1998) assert that Dossi favored landscape and religious painting over portraiture, as evidenced by the disproportionate amount of his works in landscape or religious allegories, and the abundance of information on this type of work from his studio. Notably in other Dossi works he depicts individuals with a similarly pointed nose as to the one Lucrezia is depicted with. It is possible that Lucrezia actually had such a nose shape in real life and that the artist just favored this nose shape in his other non-portrait works. However, several historians have noted that Dossi was inclined to typify physical features in his portraits instead of depicting personal features (Humfrey & Lucco, 1998).

Furthermore, this portrait created between 1519 and 1530 of Lucrezia retrospectively depicts her around the time of her death, aged 39 years old, or after her death, as a young woman in her teens or early twenties. The young Lucrezia is wearing a white *camicia* with embroidery and two buttons at the neck and pleating at the collar and cuffs. The *camicia* peaks out of the sleeve of her black gown and is greatly visible at the chest. Lucrezia's camicia features geometric embroidery and cartridge pleats at the cuffs and collar; such intricate detailing being a strong indicator of her wealthy background. The black gown Lucrezia wears is long sleeved with visible gathers/ pleats at the square neckline. Her gown also appears to have cartridge pleats and some form of braid embroidery at the neckline (the portion that is visible under the mantle). Lucrezia also appears to be wearing some form of over dress or mantle, possibly a mantle. This mantle has gathered/ cuffed sleeves that stop at the elbow and has a wide deep square neckline. Lucrezia's hair is notably cut short, parted down the middle, and cropped and falls around her chin. Lucrezia's lips are bright red, suggesting that she is wearing red coloring.

This portrait of Lucrezia was initially believed to be that of a man. Hudson (2013), amongst other scholars, previously discussed the elements within this portrait that supported this previous identification, many referencing the subject's short haircut as evidence of their gender. However, many elements of her dress are consistent with that of women's dress of the period, specifically the visible parts of Lucrezia's gown and *camicia* are consistent with early/mid 16th century. The *camicia* being exceptionally visible in the neckline of the gown was consistent for the early/mid 16th century, the full visibility of the *camicia* is indicative of a dress style that was popularized closer to the 1520s and 1530s, years after Lucrezia's death (De Young, 2019; Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). However, the style of garments Lucrezia is wearing in this depiction would have been consistent during the last few years of her life.

Further symbolism that is present within this portrait is connected to the dagger Lucrezia clasped between her hands, the two myrtle flower blooms pressed to her chest between her mantle and gown, and a piece of paper on the table in front of her that reads "Clarior hoc pvlcro regnans in corpore virtvs [More splendid is the virtue residing in this beautiful body]" in Latin, a quote derived from Virgil's Aeneid (Hudson, 2013). The dagger can possibly be an indicator of her Borgia roots and the strength and brutality that was associated with Lucrezia Borgia throughout her lifetime. However, the dagger also has connections to the symbolism of virtue (NGV, 2008). The dagger is held close to Lucrezia, possibly indicative of this characteristic of virtue being very important to her.

In this portrait of Lucrezia, she appears to depict a persona and identity that aims to break away from Lucrezia's previous "black widow" reputation. Upon her 1502 marriage to D'Este and arrival in Ferrara she was apparently described to have been wearing transparent and revealing blouse, a stark contrast from the more conservative and unadorned image she conveys

in this painting (Hagen & Hagen, 2018). While previously attributed to the fact the sitter was considered to be a man by historians, Lucrezia's lack of class and position accurate adornment could actually align with the reputation she earned as a champion of piety in Ferrara during her time as duchess (Bradford, 2004). As this portrait was painted at the earliest when Lucrezia was 39 years old or at the latest after her death, she would likely have been well removed from the reputation she earned in her youth, and her family's indiscretions and actions during her father's papacy would likely not have been common gossip any longer. By the time of this portrait's commission Lucrezia had firmly established herself as a patron to the Church in Ferrara amongst other political administration duties her husband tasked her with (Bradford, 2004). In a manner of speaking the adapted quote from Virgil seen on the edge of the composition speaks to the concept of virtue triumphing above all, as Lucrezia's youthful reputation was overshadowed by her dutiful and virtuous execution of her responsibilities as Duchess of Ferrara. Lucrezia's namesake Lucretia, an ancient roman heroine, embodied this idea of virtue as she committed suicide supposed to "avenge the dishonor brought upon her by a nobleman. Her sacrifice ultimately leading to the establishment of the Roman Republic," (Villis, n.d.).

This knowledge offers further meaning to the dagger Lucrezia possesses within the portrait as this was an extremely rare accessory for a woman to be depicted with in Italian Renaissance portraiture. At the time of this portrait Lucrezia would have been within a year of her death or already dead, been Duchess of Ferrara, and mother to five children (of which four would survive until adulthood). In many ways the typical symbolism conveyed in the dress of aristocratic Renaissance women's portraiture, such as wealth, fertility, and status, were ideals that Lucrezia intrinsically embodied and did not need to emphasize in portraiture. While at this

point her father had died during his tenure as Pope and brothers, Cesare, and Juan, were both dead leaving Lucrezia relatively independent of the Borgia family (Strathern, 2019).

This portrait showcases the identity of a woman that had lived a complex life and had finally accomplished what had been hoped and expected of her, despite the downfall of the Borgia family. Her final connection to her Borgia identity is the use of the repeated symbolism of virtue, associated with Venus who was used in the Borgia family emblem, and frequently associated with Lucrezia during this period (Hudson, 2013; Villis, n.d.). This portrait distinctly marks a shift in identity for Lucrezia. As a woman whose femininity was utilized throughout her life to benefit her family and offer social and political advantages, she is depicted in this painting without the traditional Renaissance portraiture denotations of womanhood. Instead, she is depicted with symbolisms of femineity and references to Venus.

### **Margherita Paleologo**

<span id="page-91-0"></span>Born in 1510, Margherita Paleologo was one of three daughters of Guglielmo Paleologo ( ), the Marquis of Monferrato and Anne d'Alençon of Valois ( ). Margherita was the oldest of her parents' children, and as her mother only bore daughters Margherita's future and marriage would hold heavy implications for her sisters and their family. As the last princess of a long Byzantine royal lineage, she would have brought exceptional prestige to any non-noble family she married into (Hickson, 2012; Betussi, 1545). In 1531, Margherita Paleologo married into the Gonzaga ducal family upon her marriage to Federico Gonzaga II, the 5th Marchese and subsequent 1st Duke of Mantua (1500-1540). Upon her marriage she would have entered the newly established ducal court in Mantua at the age of 21 (Hickson, 2012).

Sadly, Federico II died in 1540, and as her eldest son was not old enough to rule Margherita became co-regent with Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga (1505-1563) and Ferrante Gonzaga

(1507-1557), her brothers-in-law. Margherita provided her husband with a daughter, Isabella, and three male heirs prior to his death, Francesco, Guglielmo, and Ludovico, and was pregnant with a fourth, Federico, when Federico II died (Hickson, 2012). Throughout her life, and especially during her regency period, Margherita was noted as a very virtuous and devout woman. In Giuseppe Betussi's (1545) iteration of Boccaccio's *Donne Illustri* he explains Margherita was a devout widow and apt political ruler. Ruling throughout the Catholic Reformation and having previously been wed to Federico II in order to ensure he fathered legitimate heirs, Margherita brought stability and a vast patronage to the arts to Mantua (Hickson, 2012). Margherita would go onto die in 1566 having combined her families Monferrato territories with those of Mantua under the Gonzaga dukedom (Clayton & Whitaker, 2007; Hickson, 2012).

Margherita's own rule was heavily influenced and compared to that of her mother-in-law Isabella d'Este. Isabella d'Este was largely considered a fashion icon at the court of Mantua at the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century. Her popularization of the zazara and the voluminous sleeves are seen in depictions of many Mantuan women from the early-mid 16th century. Numerous accounts and letters speak of how Isabella favored Margherita and aided her rule of Mantua. Isabella was renowned throughout Italy for her patronage and style, as such it would be logical for the new duchess to adopt the revered dress style of her mother-in-law (Clayton & Whitaker, 2007; Hickson, 2012).

### <span id="page-92-0"></span>**Romano Portrait, 1531 (p[.131\)](#page-140-0)**

Giulio Romano (1499-1546) created this portrait of Margherita Paleologo in 1531. Romano was primarily known for his emphasis on biblical and allegorical works, as a result of his mentorship by noted High Renaissance artist Raphael and their work on the Papal

Loggie for Pope Leo X. However, in 1524, Romano was brought to the court of Mantua under the invitation of Federico II Gonzaga to decorate and design rooms in the Palazzo del Tè (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008; Vasari, 1550-1568/1912-1915). Vasari (1550-1568/1912-1915) noted that from Romano's work with Raphael he learned how to faithfully depict architecture in his paintings to scale using perspective. Romano's attention to detail and accuracy are exceptionally clear in this painting in not just with his diligence in depicting Margherita's rooms in the background, but in his rendering of her garments and accessories. It is therefore likely that Romano's skills and tutelage under Raphael were thought of when he was asked to complete a portrait of the duke's new wife.

This portrait of Margherita so heavily features the dress style of her mother-in-law that many historians had previously attributed it to Isabella d'Este. However, due to the period and inventories from Margherita's household historians have identified the sitter as Margherita (Clayton & Whitaker, 2007). A medal from 1561 created by Pastorino de' Pastorini has been referenced by historians to confirm Margherita's likeness in this portrait as it is the only confirmed depiction of her (Clayton & Whitaker, 2007).

Margherita is wearing a *camicia* under a two layered gown. The outer-gown seems to be made of woven together black strips of fabric with gold trim that create chain links described as *fantasie dei vinci* ("fantasies of the win") (Clayton & Whitaker, 2007). The brocade under-gown is visible through the black links of the *fantasie dei vinci*. The Royal Collection Trust (n.d.) theorizes that the black strips are made of a heavy silk, while the under-gown (originally a pale crimson) could be made of any number of high-quality fabrics of the period. The sleeves of the gown are in the large voluminous baragoni style popular in Italy during this period.

Margherita's accessories directly speak to her new Mantuan home, but also the influence of her mother-in-law. She is depicted wearing a zazara, of gold strands with a large floral brooch in the center front. The wearing of a zazara is significant as this head accessory was popular in Mantua (Gonzaga territory) during this period. The head accessory was thought to have been popularized by Margherita's mother-in-law, Isabella d'Este (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008). Margherita is wearing a set of pearl drop earrings with gold settings, and a long gold chain necklace that is laid twisted near her bust. Margherita is also wearing a gold woven/chain girdle, from which a lapis lazuli rosary hangs and which she uses her left hand to hold up one strand of. As lapis lazuli is and was an incredibly rare and expensive mineral the fact that her entire very long rosary is made of such a material is a key indicator of status (Clayton & Whitaker, 2007). She also has a total of three rings: two on her right hand one that appears to showcase gold leaves and a silver stone in the middle sits on her index finger, and the other a simple gold band with a small red jewel sits on her pinky finger; on her left hand is an elaborate gold ornamented band with a circular black stone in the middle which sits on her index finger. In her right hand she grasps a pair of gold-colored gloves.

The wearing of a zazara and *fantasie dei vinci* showcase the way Margherita abandoned the dress traditions of her home when taken under the wing of her mother-in-law in her new home (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008). The lapis lazuli rosary that Margherita holds further showcases her new alignment with the Gonzaga family. Mentioned in a 1531 letter, Federico sent his bride a similar necklace which Margherita was said to have styled with a zazara (Clayton & Whitaker, 2007). While the painting otherwise lacks overt symbolism to the Gonzaga family, aside from the adaptation of her mother-in-law's signature style, knowledge of the possible origins of her rosary indicates intentionality in its inclusion in this painting. Margherita wearing

and holding the rosary in her hands speaks directly to her renowned piety and devotion, in addition to a possible tangible desire for her husband as she holds his gift close (Hickson, 2012; Betussi, 1545). While not overly bedecked in jewels or fertility symbolism as other new brides were in period portraiture, Margherita conveys her allegiance as a new Gonzaga wife and the first Duchess of Mantua in her Mantuan through dress.

### **Eleonora di Toledo**

<span id="page-95-0"></span>Eleonora di Toledo was born in 1522 into Spanish nobility. Her family raised her in Naples because of her father's appointment by Emperor Charles V as a Viceroy there in 1533. With this, Eleonora grew up with the influence of both the Habsburg and Spanish courts, in addition to becoming familiar with Italian customs. As a result of her numerous political connections and royal blood, she likely was raised in an environment that prepared her for a political marriage that would benefit her family. This was the same perspective of her future husband Cosimo de' Medici (1519-1574), who aimed to find a wife that would present further credibility to his dukedom amongst other ruling powers across Italy and Europe, specifically those within the Holy Roman Empire (Cox-Rearick, 2009; Sale Holian, 2008). Therefore in 1539 Eleonora married Duke Cosimo de' Medici, two years into his appointed dukedom (Cox-Rearick, 2009).

Upon arriving in Florence, Eleonora was not well welcomed by the Florentine people in response to her Spanish heritage and the Medici family's destruction of the long-standing Florentine Republic in favor for the Medici dukedom. In an effort to quell unrest, and solidify his reign, Eleonora's second function within their political marriage would have been to provide a male heir (Cox-Rearick, 2009; Sale Holian, 2008). Eleonora was quick to accomplish this task providing Cosimo with five sons that survived infancy, Francesco born in 1541, Giovanni born

in 1543, Pietro in 1546, Garzia born in 1547, and Ferdinando born in 1549. In addition to her sons gave birth to a total of eleven children including four daughters (Maria, b. 1540; Lucrezia b. 1545; Isabella; Anna b. 1553). However, only three of Eleonora's children would live to adulthood (Ferdinando, Francesco, and Isabella) to continue the family dynasty through political marriages (Sale Holian, 2008; Cox-Rearick, 2009; Langdon, 2006).

In addition to providing her husband with numerous children and heirs, she was widely regarded as a ruler for her intelligence and co-ruling of Florence with her husband. Duke Cosimo frequently travelled outside of Florence, leaving his wife Duchess Eleonora to rule as regent in his steed. This led to Eleonora being privy to a level of privilege, power, and independence unprecedented by other duchesses or consorts of the period (Langdon, 2006; Sale Holian, 2008). Unfortunately, Eleonora's life was cut short at forty years old, after she became ill while traveling with her sons Giovanni and Garzia, with all three dying months apart in 1562 (Langdon, 2006). Many of the portraits depicting Eleonora in life capture her evolving dress style and identity presentation, frequently at the hands of court painter, Agnolo Bronzino (1503- 1572) (Gáldy & Bronzino, 2013).

Agnolo Bronzino is noted for his apt blending of the Italo-Hispanic artistic stylings at the court of Duke Cosimo I and Eleonora di Toledo. Portraits of this period of women frequently convey a "dynastic message" (p. 37), in which the women are painted as the perfect aristocratic bride. Eleonora in many portraits is seen as the ideal "dynastic bride, the mother of many male children, a lady of proud Spanish lineage, even as some kind of terrestrial Virgin Mary," (p. 37). The portraits painted of Eleonora later in her life by Bronzino do not showcase her illness. A select few portraits show her progressively getting more ill. Bronzino's Medici portraits are noted for their similarities to photographs. Specifically, Bronzino is noted for his depiction of

expensive textiles and geometric lace, such as the partlet and collars. Bronzino paints his sheer textiles over opaque objects to get the truly sheer effect. Some of Bronzino's portraits such as the "Eleonora of Toledo and Her Son Francesco" at Museo Nazionale di Palazzo Reale, Pisa from 1549-50, are noted for straying from Bronzino's typical level of detail, hinting at a workshop composition (Gáldy & Bronzino, 2013).

### <span id="page-97-0"></span>**Bronzino Portrait, c. 1545 (p[.133\)](#page-142-0)**

Eleonora was approximately 23 years old when this portrait was completed. By this time, she was married and had a male heir outside of infancy, meaning in the eyes of period expectations, she had fulfilled her purpose in the Medici dynasty.

Eleonora's dress in this portrait speaks to a specific communicated identity. Her gown is textured in a way that is similar to the green background of the composition, which could imply that it is velvet. The way Bronzino depicted the light hitting the fabric is consistent with period depictions of velvet. The sleeves on her *zimarra* also indicate slashing, a typical Italian sleeve embellishment, which hints at her Spanglo-Italian style. Eleonora wears a gold girdle that hangs in her lap, possibly a symbolism of her fertility. She also has a seemingly gold string knotted around her neck, which could possibly be a closure for the partlet.

Her *zimarra* is trimmed in gold braid as is her gown, and she wears pearl necklaces, a pearl and gold net partlet, and a gold and pearl snood. The *camicia* underneath her gown and *zimarra* has the sleeve cuff peeking out, with a hint at geometric blackwork on it, which is indicative of her Spanish heritage, as it was believed Catherine of Aragon (1485-1536) popularized the trend, having brought it to northern Europe upon her marriage to King Henry VIII (Gostelow, 1998).

The geometric design on the trim of her *zimarra* is in contrast with Italian textiles of the period that feature florals, furthering Eleonora's long running notoriety of maintaining elements of her Spanish dress while living her life at the Medici court in Florence (Herald, 1993a). Numerous accounts highlight the fact that her choice to remain in Spanish dress while adopting elements of Italian/Florentine style, in lieu of completely adopting Italian fashions, garnered her many Florentine critics (Cox-Rearick, 2009; Cox-Rearick & Bulgarella, 2013; Langdon, 2006).

The styling of Eleonora in this portrait with her Medici son is a combination of her numerous identities: her Spanish heritage, her Neapolitan upbringing, and her Florentine marriage. Her insistence to remain in *alla Spagnola*, while perceived as stubborn and disloyal to her husband's home, was in actuality an acknowledgement of power and the allegiance to the Spanish court her marriage to Duke Cosimo I brought. As the Medici dukedom in Florence was new following the decades long Florentine Republic, Eleonora's *alla Spagnola* dress identity indicated the dukedom was formally recognized and supported by the Spanish court (Cox-Rearick, 2009).

Furthermore, Eleonora was noted for favoring more simplistic textiles for her gowns, evidenced in this Bronzino portrait, despite having access to the most elaborate and intricate textiles in Europe. Thus, meaning while she dressed *alla Spagnola*, her dress was still considered "accessible" in a way that she as a duchess was not. This distinction between a typical foreign dresser and that of a duchess was made in her jewelry. The abundance of her favored pearls and the diamonds on her chain girdle denotes her as a Medici (Sale Holian, 2008). The pairing of her nobility with her husband's new status is similar to that of her husband's 15th century forefather Cosimo the Elder who married Contessina di Bardi a woman of aristocratic blood to bring legitimacy to the growing Medici empire at the time.

### <span id="page-99-0"></span>**Bronzino Portrait, 1545-1546 (p. [132\)](#page-141-0)**

Similar to the previous Bronzino portrait, Eleonora was young and about six years into her marriage to Cosimo I Duke of Tuscany. Having now provided two male heirs and possibly being pregnant with her third son (Pietro, born 1546), at the time of this commission her status throughout Europe as a beautiful, intelligent, and competent duchess for her husband would be known through this portrait (Sale Holian, 2008; Cox-Rearick, 2009; Langdon, 2006).

Eleonora is wearing a brocade gown with slashed sleeves and a rigid *alla Spagnola* bodice and a *camicia* is worn underneath the gown and visible through slashing and at the gown cuffs. The brocade gown appears to be made with black voided velvet and a possible silk organza base. The artist also conveyed the gold threads and rope trim. This portrait highlights Bronzino's famous intricate depictions of textiles, and the status symbol such complex and luxurious textiles conveyed about the level of unattainably wealth families such as the Medici possessed (Gáldy & Bronzino, 2013; Goldthwaite, 1993).

In addition to luxurious Florentine textiles, the accessories Eleonora is depicted wearing present numerous other insights into her conveyed identity. Eleonora wears a gold crusted chain linked girdle with jewels every few chain lengths (diamonds, rubies, and emeralds), and pearl strands gathered at the end of the belt to hang, a gold net snood head piece with pearls, and two pearl necklaces (one with a jewel). The diamond necklace she wears is worn in a very prominent place on her neck attached to a strand of pearls, the symbolism within this is that the diamond (statement jewel of the Medici) and the pearls (a symbol of beauty, piety, and virtue) speak to Eleonora's membership to the family and her contributions (Sale Holian, 2008; Raber, 2011). The idea that she was likely pregnant at the time of this commission makes the pomegranate motif, a notable symbol of fertility of the time, that much more poignant of an inclusion in this

portrait. Furthermore, the numerous placements of pearls on her garments and accessories hint at not only her personal preference but to the need to communicate the previously mentioned characteristics attached to wearing pearls.

Every aspect of this portrait hints at Eleonora's intersectional identity. The diamonds she wears identify her visually as part of the Medici dynasty, while the pearls, said to have been a personal preference and a common accessory ("Pearls are a ubiquitous component of every sixteenth-century female aristocrat's dress," [Sale Holian, 2008, p. 157]) were symbolic of beauty as well as chastity and purity during the Renaissance (Sale Holian, 2008; Raber, 2011). These attributes would have been very important for Eleonora to convey as she was a devote Spanish-Italian Catholic of royal blood.

The elaborateness of this gown shines opposite from many of Eleonora's personal stylistic tastes, especially this early in her marriage, as at the time she still incorporated many Spanish style garments such as the *zimarra* into her wardrobe (Cox-Rearick, 2009). However, as this is one of the earliest portraits of Eleonora by Bronzino and certainly the most prominent, in essence serving as a decree of the strength of the Medici lineage and fertility from its new duchess, it is easy to understand why Eleonora has dawned distinctly Florentine and Italian stylings. From the voided velvet brocade gown to the Italian Renaissance baragoni sleeves and famous Italian sleeve slashing. Every aspect is intended to communicate wealth and an Italian aesthetic, and more importantly the wealth and power of the Medici family. The large gemstones that decorate her neck and her girdle call to the Medici proclivity towards expensive jewels (Sale Holian, 2008).

### <span id="page-101-0"></span>**Bronzino Portrait, 1575-1599 (p[.134\)](#page-143-0)**

This portrait of Eleonora (d. 1562), is an example of one of Bronzino's post-mortem portraits, likely commissioned to honor the anniversary of her death by her son, Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici. This portrait notably differs from other portraits created in life which depicted her with a fuller face and dressed *alla Spagnola*. It should be noted that despite the regal implications, in life Eleonora did not frequently wear black and gold, typical regal Spanish colors, and inventories of her wardrobe from the period indicate she did not own any gold and black attire such as the gown she is depicted in within this portrait (Cox-Rearick, 2009). This fact further facilitates the idea that Bronzino was tasked with communicating a regal identity for Eleonora in death that more aligned with the stylings of the period and class conventions, than her own personal style choices.

The extra-long string of pearls, a favorite gemstone of Eleonora, she wears in the portrait speaks to the period characteristics for noblewomen associated with pearls, such as beauty, purity, and chastity, which when paired with the very conservative style of her high necked partlet (not a style she would have worn in life) this intended communication of a pure, pious, Spanish-Italian Catholic woman is clear (Sale Holian, 2008; Raber, 2011). A similar portrait by Alessandro Allori from 1572 (Cox-Rearick, 2009, p. 60), ten years after her death, depicts her in similar garments that more align with Northern European and Elizabethan style conventions and not Eleonora's Spanglo-Italian preferences. Cox-Rearick (2009) justifies this court dress identity shift after Eleonora's death to political alliances with individuals leaning towards Austro-Hispanic dress influences. By the time of the painting of this portrait Francesco de' Medici had remarried a Habsburg princess, Giovanna di Austria, who brought that Austro-Hispanic styling to court (Cox-Rearick, 2009).

### **Bianca Cappello**

<span id="page-102-0"></span>Bianca Cappello was born in Venice in 1548 to a noble family. Her affair with Francesco de' Medici (d. 1587) likely began sometime after her 1563 elopement and pregnancy with Piero Buonaventuri. Bianca remained Francesco's mistress even upon his marriage to Giovanna of Austria and his ascension to becoming the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1576, Bianca gave birth to Francesco's first son Antonio. Following the murder and sudden death in childbirth of their respective spouses in 1578, the two lovers wed. Although Bianca was unable to provide Francesco any more children following their marriage, they are said to have lived a happy and loving marriage. In 1587, Bianca died at the age of 39 (Musacchio, 2019).

Many of the portraits commissioned throughout Bianca Cappello's time within the Medici court were created by Alessandro Allori (1535-1607). Allori was a student, family friend, and surrogate son of Agnolo Bronzino, known for his tenure as the court painter in Florence during the mid to late 16th century, Allori worked alongside his mentor throughout his early career in Florence at the Medici court (Pilliod, 2001).

### <span id="page-102-1"></span>**Allori Portrait, 1560-1585 (p[.135\)](#page-144-0)**

This portrait by Alessandro Allori is distinctly different from later portraits of Bianca after she became Grand Duchess of Tuscany in 1579 (Musacchio, 2019). Compared to other Allori court portraits of Bianca (1584-1587, c. 1580-1614, and c. 1580), this features her appearing the youngest and with a slenderer face. With this knowledge, it is likely that this portrait of Bianca was created between 1563 and 1579. The theory that this is a younger Bianca prior to her marriage to Francesco is further justified in Bianca's lack of extravagance (i.e., lace, jewelry, fine textiles, etc.), in addition to the not as obvious *alla Spagnola* dress conventions she is depicted wearing. Before Bianca became Grand Duchess, she would have experienced less

pressure to comply with dress standards of other ruling monarchs and aristocrats, as evidenced by the garments and styles seen in this portrait.

Bianca wears a white large stand-up ruffled collar, a red outer-gown with red and white evolved baragoni sleeves. The bodice features white fabric puffs on the shoulders, and gold braid loop button closures down the center front of the outer-gown. Bianca is wearing gold choker necklace, white pearl tear-drop earrings, and a wide long gold chain necklace. Bianca's wearing of pearls and gold can be indicative of her membership to the aristocracy (Raber, 2011). She is wearing her curly reddish-brown hair parted down the middle and pulled back into a bun with a gold band headpiece adorned with red jewels. Her bun features white ribbons tied throughout.

Allori appears to utilize color in this torso portrait of Bianca to convey numerous elements of her identity. The use of white draws the eyes to Bianca's face and her neck where she showcases ruff. Furthermore, the regal gold, white, and red of her outer-gown and bodice aid in showcasing status. The white puffs and her white sleeves aid in moving the eye initially from the pearl earrings and the white ribbons Bianca is wearing in her hair, to the white ruff, to the white pearls dispersed throughout. The prominence of the dark rich colors on her bodice/ gown are intended to hint at Bianca's royal status and the detail in the brocade textiles are likely to inspire awe. However, lack of Medici symbolism, such as through jewelry, within the portrait stands out. This is possibly an indicator that this portrait is prior to her marrying into the Medici family.

This portrait notably marks a period in Italy in which foreign influence on dress dominated as a result of numerous political and social influences throughout the latter half of the century. Additionally, this portrait showcases the growing popularity of the ruff and large collars coming from Northern Europe to Italy.

### <span id="page-104-0"></span>**Allori Portrait, 1580 (p[.136\)](#page-145-0)**

Completed in 1580, this Alessandro Allori portrait of Bianca depicts her between 36 and 39 years old. Bianca's depiction in this portrait more closely aligns with other Allori portraits of her including *Portrait of Bianca Capello (1584-1587)* and *Portrait of Duchess Bianca Capello de Medici with Her Son (c. 1580-1614)*. The former portrait depicts Bianca in a similar style of dress and color scheme of red, gold, and white. However, this portrait shows more status and identity symbolism than the *Allori (1560-1585)* portrait, indicating again that the earlier Allori portrait is likely a less formal portrait than this one as indicated through dress, and was probably intended for private consumption.

Bianca is depicted in this portrait wearing a white bobbin lace trimmed *camicia* which is slightly visible at the sleeve cuffs and her neckline. She wears a white and gold under-gown with long sleeves featuring rows of slashing separated into rows by gold trim. Bianca's outer-gown, likely a silk brocade, features a long open sleeve that allows the under-gown sleeve to be visible. The outer-gown features embroidered pearls along the trims and the outer-gown is lined with a white fabric and gold threads. The trims are paired with floral and ogee motifs on the outergown's brocade fabric. Her neckline features a lace collar, reminiscent of a ruff. Bianca is wearing two white pearl necklaces, one is a single string choker, the other a double strand that falls to her mid torso. She is also wearing a jeweled ring in a gold setting on her wedding ring finger. On Bianca's head, she wears pearl drop earrings and has what is likely pearl hairpins placed in her hair, the largest at the middle part of the front of her head. Bianca also has a black and gold lace veil, known as a *tocchiglia*, attached to the back of her hair that flows past her shoulders in length.

Allori utilizes the color of Bianca's garments to highlight and emphasize certain elements of her dress identity. The use of white draws the eyes to Bianca's face and her neck where she showcases status indicators such as the needle lace ruff and her pearl jewelry. Furthermore, the regal gold, white, and possibly silver of her outer and under-gown and bodice aid in showcasing the complex textiles and style of her gown. The delicate white pearls embroidered throughout her gown aid in moving the eye initially from the pearl earrings and necklace that Bianca is wearing, to the white ruff, to the white pearls dispersed throughout. The prominence of the dark rich colors on her bodice and gown are intended to hint at Bianca's royal status and the detail in the brocade textiles are likely to inspire awe. Additionally, the red/pink carnation placed at Bianca's neckline further draws the eyes to the v-shape of his neckline and her hand touching the pearls at the edge of the neckline.

Similar to later Allori portraits of Bianca, this portrait features the inclusion of a red flower, likely a carnation, tucked into her bodice neckline. The inclusion of the red carnation tucked into her bodice is an example of overt period symbolism, as during the Renaissance the inclusion of carnations in northern Italian Renaissance art referred to love and marriage (Meagher, 2007). Considering historic records of Francesco and Bianca's love marriage, this would be a consistent symbolism to include in the portrait. This is specifically relevant as the date of this portrait places it just a year after their 1579 marriage.

It has been noted that historically speaking the Florentine people were not fans of their marriage as they viewed Bianca brought little to benefit Florence (Musacchio, 2019). As a result, the public dislike for the duke marrying her only a year after his wife's death would incentivize Bianca to cultivate a very specific public identity and persona to gather respect. The ornate gown and jewelry in which she is depicted and the regal manner, consistent with other women of the

period of similar social status, in which she holds herself was likely to convince viewers of the royal portrait of her elevated status as the mother to the duke's heir, his wife, and the Grand Duchess of Tuscany. This paired with the carnation and her visible wedding ring convey not only her new elevated status as Grand Duchess but her aim to convey true and genuine love for Francesco.

### **Allori Portrait, 1584-1587 (p. [137\)](#page-146-0)**

This portrait was likely one of the last works Alessandro Allori completed for the Grand Duchess, as she died in 1587. Likely being between the ages of 36 and 39 years old, Bianca's depiction in this portrait is consistent with other portraits created by Allori during this period, lending credit to the specific dress identity she wished to convey in her last years.

Bianca wears an *alla Spagnola* bodice of red and gold velvet brocade, with small, puffed sleeve caps with sleeve slashing that exposes her white *camicia* underneath. Due to her status as a Grand Duchess her *camicia* would likely have been made of high-quality linen or silk. Bianca is also depicted wearing a white needle lace ruff collar attached to her outer bodice, with her lace trimmed *camicia* visible at the v-shaped neckline. In this painting Bianca is depicted with slightly simpler accessories as she wears a short single strand white pearl necklace, teardrop shaped pearl earrings, and a gold lace *tocchiglia* attached to her pulled back hair.

Staying consistent with his other portraits Allori effectively used color to highlight and sideline certain elements of Bianca's dress identity and appearance. The use of white draws the eyes to Bianca's face and her neck where she showcases status indicators such as the needle lace ruff and her pearl jewelry. Furthermore, the regal red and gold of her gown and bodice aid in showcasing the complex textiles and style of her gown. The delicate white pearls embroidered throughout her gown aid in moving the eye initially from the pearl earrings and necklace that

Bianca is wearing, to the white ruff, to the white pearls dispersed throughout. The prominence of the dark rich colors on her bodice/gown are intended to hint at Bianca's royal status and the detail in the brocade red and gold textiles are likely to inspire awe. Additionally, the red carnation placed at Bianca's neckline further draws the eyes to the v-shape of his neckline.

The purpose of this portrait, while not definitively known, is clearly different from Allori's other portraits of Bianca at the time. There is a distinct lack of overt symbolism in dress that are abundant in his other portraits. This could indicate that the portrait was likely intended for private consumption and would have been placed in the private apartments of the ducal family. This is evidenced in the inclusion of a red flower, likely a carnation, tucked into her bodice neckline. As previously mentioned, this flower held period symbolism associated with love and marriage, a concept that would be consistent with period records of Francesco and Bianca's love filled marriage (Meagher, 2007). This is specifically relevant as the date of this portrait places it several years after their 1579 marriage, and a minimum of two years after the death of Francesco's legitimate son and heir, and thus the ascension of Bianca's son Antonio to the position of heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. This shift in position, would have solidified Bianca's status as Francesco's wife and duchess, and represents the last obstacle in their union and life (Musacchio, 2019).

### <span id="page-107-0"></span>**Unknown Artist Portrait, 1585-1599 (p[.138\)](#page-147-0)**

This portrait completed by an unknown artist between 1585 and 1599 presents insight into the manner in which Bianca conveyed her identity in her last few years similar to the previous Allori portrait. In this portrait she is depicted as a young woman, which would be inaccurate as she would be 37 years old at the time this painting was commissioned. However, the younger depiction could be a nostalgic retrospective of her more youthful self when she first

met her husband Francesco in her twenties. There are numerous elements within her dress identity in this portrait that support this theory.

Bianca's dress is very similar to that of her in previous portraits of this period, creating a disjointed identity from the youthful Bianca's actual dress and style preferences. In this portrait Bianca is depicted wearing a small white lace collar with a supportasse, a lace trimmed *camicia* visible through her v-shaped neckline. She wears a dark grey v-shaped bodice with an undergown visible as her sleeves poke out from the outer-gown revealing a grey or silver sleeve and gold trim. At the armscye the little grey puffs are remanent of an evolved baragoni sleeve.

Bianca is painted wearing an abundance of jewelry and accessories, in contrast to *Allori 1584-1587 portrait*. She wears a choker length strand of pearls and a double string of pearls. She also has a gold brooch pinned at the bottom of her v-neckline, likely with some familial emblem, however due to image quality this is uncertain. Finally, she wears teardrop shaped pearl earrings, which are consistently seen in numerous of her portraits, and an assortment of flowers in her hair, along with a white lace *tocchiglia*.

While the disconnect between the dress conventions of a middle-aged Bianca and the face of a youthful Bianca are evident in this portrait, her dress identity is most clearly consistent with evolving dress practices in Florence at the time. This portrait notably marks a period in Italy in which foreign influence on dress dominates as a result of numerous political and social influences throughout the latter half of the century. The dress featured in this painting shows the spread of *alla Spagnola* style and English style to Italy and Italian courts during this period. Despite the Florentine style dominating Florence throughout the Italian Renaissance and the early 16th century, this painting shows an end of that (Musacchio, 2019).

The combining of identities in this portrait of Bianca speaks to her desire to remain youthful and beautiful, as well as maintaining the dress identity she created over the previous decade. The white lace *tocchiglia* and updo hair indicate her status as a married woman, along with the abundance of pearls signifying purity, likely religious purity, and wealth (Raber, 2011). Her choice to adopt foreign styles of dress can possibly be attributed to her Venetian upbringing, and the fact that throughout her relationship and subsequent marriage to Francesco the people of Florence never grew to like her (Meagher, 2007; Musacchio, 2019). Similarly, her choice in dress, specifically the ruff could be a decision made to emulate such popular female rulers of the time such as Queen Elizabeth I (Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). While her husband and familial life were notably documented through personal correspondence as happy, it is possible that through her dress identity and public persona such as the one depicted in this painting, she aimed to garner the respect and support of the people she ruled (Meagher, 2007; Musacchio, 2019).

### **CHAPTER 5. CONCLUSION**

<span id="page-110-0"></span>The twenty-one portraits of Eleonora di Toledo, Bianca Cappello, Caterina Sforza, Cecilia Gallerani, Giulia Farnese, Bianca Maria Sforza, Lucrezia Borgia, Isabella d'Este, and Margherita Paleologo concentrated in 16th century Italy convey this period's exceptional reputation for portraiture and the display of status through dress and other forms of consumerism. Dress was utilized in a number of ways by these women as evidenced in their portraiture. Eight prominent themes emerged across the twenty-one portraits which reference the use of dress in relation to concepts of conveyed status, personal preferences, religious references and characteristics, and social and political allegiances with their birth families or their husbands' families.

The use of dress to convey status throughout the portraits appeared most prominently in reference to wealth, marriage, and positions within court. Bianca Cappello and Bianca Maria Sforza established all three of these identities within their portraiture. Due to the upward social mobility of both women, it would have been exceptionally important for both women to communicate status in their portraiture. Bianca Cappello represented the ideal situation of a mistress, as she was elevated to Grand Duchess of Tuscany following the death of her lover's wife, while Bianca Maria Sforza, a notable duke's daughter, became Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. Bianca's *de' Predis (1493)* portrait and Bianca Cappello's *Allori (1580)* and *Allori (1584-1587)* portraits feature a carnation flower, a symbol of love and marriage prominent in the period. Both women's early portraiture displayed many elements of wealth such as specific jewels and extravagant textiles, however their later portraiture included an altogether different dress style that not only displayed their elevated wealth following marriage, but the ways they referenced their new status as rulers in their different styles of dress.

Religious symbols appeared in several of the portraits, with direct allegorical references, indirect symbolism, and political references to Catholicism and the Catholic Church. Caterina Sforza and Giulia Farnese each had an allegorical portrait in which they were depicted as saints, St. Catherine and the Madonna, respectively. More subtle references appeared in the portraits of Lucrezia Borgia and Caterina Sforza in the form of flowers or other objects typically associated with specific saints. However, the most common religious references were the inclusion of a crucifix, rosary, or the purposeful inclusion of red within the portrait. These religious references occurred in almost every portrait, with some references as subtle as the implied inclusion, such as the dark string necklace tucked into a bodice as seen in the *de' Predis (1493)* portrait of Bianca Maria Sforza. These religious references, especially in the 16th century, would have been paramount to their conveyed identity of allegiance to the Catholic Church at a time when the Catholic Church faced increased public scrutiny.

While conveying loyalty or membership to the Catholic Church was a high priority in their conveyed identity, many of these women aimed to convey religion-based characteristics associated with femininity including piety, purity, and humility. Purity was often exhibited by wearing pearls. Lucrezia Borgia, Giulia Farnese, and Caterina Sforza conveyed symbolism of purity in more overt ways. These three women lived controversial lives that garnered them tarnished reputations, as such, each had a portrait in which they aimed to manipulate their public persona. They were depicted in dress styles that were both conservative for the period and illfitting to their social statuses at the time all in favor of presenting a curated identity of piety, purity, and humility.

Dress was also used to convey allegiances and embodied characteristics by incorporating references to one's heritage or home region. Eleonora di Toledo and Bianca Maria Sforza, after

marrying outside of their cultures and home regions, utilized this form of identity convention to express allegiance and cultural preferences. Eleonora di Toledo was known throughout her time in Florence for favoring *alla Spagnola* dress, and this dress style is present in several of her portraits. Bianca Maria Sforza, similarly, wore the dress of the Milanese court in the portraiture of the first few years of her marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor, before adopting the dress style of the Habsburg court. The choice to favor and be depicted in the dress style of their home was not only a personal preference but a choice that conveyed allegiance and status. Eleonora's *alla Spagnola* dress style reminded individuals of the royal lineage she brought to the new nonnoble blooded Medici dukedom, while Bianca Maria Sforza's initial Milanese dress choices speak to her personal preference and her early political allegiance to her uncle, the Duke of Milan. As both women moved further into their marriages, their style appeared to evolve from paying homage to their respective families, to conveying loyalty to the stronger and more immediate political powers within their new homes.

More overt indications to the women's heritage through dress appeared in the form of direct and indirect references to their birth families. These references were included by depicting dress styles invented or popularized by a family member, incorporating the family name or motto in one element of dress, and through utilizing an object or animal as a symbolic reference to their family. Including references to a woman's birth family within portraiture was a strong communicator of personal affiliation with their family, regardless of marital status, or their husband's political stance with their birth families. Bianca Maria Sforza and Isabella d'Este are an example of this idea as each suggested affiliation with the House of Sforza, by wearing coazzone braids and ferronière respectively in at least one of their portraits. Both dress elements connect to Beatrice d'Este, Duchess of Milan, and speak to the broader influence Milanese style

had throughout Italy during this period, and the tight ties between the d'Este and Sforza families, communicated in subtle ways through dress. Similarly, other portraiture of Bianca Maria Sforza and Lucrezia Borgia feature direct familial references in the form of their family mottos being incorporated in dress or elsewhere within the composition. Lucrezia Borgia, along with her father's mistress Giulia Farnese, feature allegorical references to their families within their portraiture, as the Farnese family emblem includes a unicorn, which is depicted in Giulia's portrait, and references to Venus and virtue, which are included in the Borgia family crest. For daughters of prominent families such as the Sforzas, Farneses, and Borgias, the inclusion of direct and indirect references to their families would communicate a loyalty to not only their families but to the principals and founding characteristics of their families.

While referencing their birth family and home regions was a prominent feature in the dress identity of many of these women, referencing the cultural dress styles of their husband's region was also a common theme. In some instances, these references appeared in portraits commissioned later into the marriage, such as with Bianca Maria Sforza, or at the beginning of the marriage when representing foreign style would not be perceived well by the public, such as with Eleonora di Toledo. Similarly, Cecilia Gallerani and Margherita Paleologo's portraits represent not only the difference between the conveyed identity of a mistress and a duchess, but the different ways they embraced their partner's culture. Cecilia is depicted wearing common styles of the Milanese court of her lover, while Margherita is notably depicted in a dress style popular in Mantua, that was brought to the region by her mother-in-law, Isabella d'Este.

Margherita Paleologo's depiction in the dress of her mother-in-law displays the common theme of directly referencing their spouse or spouses' family. Bianca Maria Sforza's *1505-1510 portrait by Strigel* (The Metropolitan Museum of Art) offers one of the few overt and direct

references to her husband, as her gown is embroidered with their initials. Less overt references can be found in the background elements and non-dress related objects within some of the women's portraitures. Cecilia Gallerani famously holds a white ermine over her heart as a less direct reference to her lover, Ludovico Sforza, who was colloquially known as Ermellino Bianco (white ermine). In a show of strength over love and affection, Caterina Sforza is depicted with a view of the countryside of her husband's territories behind her, and in her *Di Credi (1481-1483)* portrait what is likely the Rocca Sforzesca, the family fortress, is depicted.

Caterina Sforza's portraiture possesses many of the unique qualities she herself held, including a lack of traditionalism. Along with Margherita Paleologo, Lucrezia Borgia, Bianca Cappello, Isabella d'Este, and Bianca Maria Sforza's portraiture, Caterina's portraits lacked elements of traditional symbolism of the period befitting their statuses. Their portraits lacked such elements as fertility motifs, dress that aligned with period mourning conventions, or references to their husband or his family. In at least one portrait each of these women conveyed their active ambivalence to tradition or preference to presenting their personal style. Notably, Bianca Maria, Bianca, and Margherita lacked fertility motifs in their portraits commissioned during the early years of their marriage, when such symbolism would be expected. In contrast, Isabella d'Este's portraiture following her husband's death showcases her in regular dress embracing her own personal style and new status as the matriarch of the family, and not as a widow. The rationale behind the lack of symbolism in some of these women's portraitures ultimately speaks to a conveyed individual identity that was likely heavily influenced by each of their familial, political, or romantic situations at the time.

Each of these nine women embodied many of the period expectations of mothers, wives, mistresses, and rulers. However, all of them found ways to communicate their personal identities

through dress, in their portraits, during their lifetimes. The methods Eleonora di Toledo, Caterina Sforza, Bianca Maria Sforza, Cecilia Gallerani, Isabella d'Este, Margherita Paleologo, Lucrezia Borgia, and Giulia Farnese used to have period concepts of power, privilege, and identity conveyed in their portraiture can be directly connected to contemporary concepts of identity presentation in media.

### **Contemporary Implications**

<span id="page-115-0"></span>Portraiture remains a prominent form of art and status convention in the modern world. High profile individuals such as Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain and other ruling monarchs have their image commemorated in paintings or photographic portraits annually to celebrate anniversaries or birthdays. In recent years, Former President Barack Obama and Former First Lady Michelle Obama notably had their likenesses painted by Kehinde Wiley (b. 1977) and Amy Sherald (b. 1973) following President Obama's final term. Similar to the occasional tensions and socio-political motivations of selecting an artist these nine women experienced, the selection of Wiley and Sherald carried with them their own implications. Wiley and Sherald were the first African American artists to ever be selected by the National Portrait Gallery to commission presidential or first lady portraits (Caragol, 2020).

Wiley was previously known for his re-imagined portraiture of African American individuals in the poses of historically significant individuals in Western history. For example, his painting *Napoleon Leading the Army Over the Alps* (2005), features a young man riding a bucking horse, in the same pose as Napoleon in Jacques-Louis David's portrait, however Wiley's subject wears garments significant to African American culture such as Timberland shoes in the portrait (Caragol, 2020). Similarly, Sherald's portraiture career focused on uplifting African

American experiences by increasing the body of portraiture featuring African Americans (Moss, 2020).

In addition of the intentional selection of the artists, the Obama portraits both feature numerous identity conventions. Similar to Caterina Sforza's *di Credi* portrait (1481-1483) flowers hold personal meaning in Wiley's depiction of Barack Obama. The flowers seen in the background of Wiley's portrait are three blossoms, each indigenous to Kenya, Chicago, and Hawai'i.(Caragol, 2020). Sherald, who selected Mrs. Obama's dress in the portrait, selected it not only based on its fashionable design, but as it reminded her of the famous African American quilters of Gee's Bend, Alabama, tying together Mrs. Obama's own journey to the White House with those hard-working women (Moss, 2020). While the Obama portraits toured the country and were presented to the public, they are a contemporary reminder of the distinct class divide between those that can afford to have formal portraits created of themselves.

21st century social media provides a more relatable platform to individuals than formal portraiture does. Platforms such as Instagram, an image-based platform, offers a way for people to present a curated public identity. Like the way these 16th century women frequently conveyed their status in terms of wealth, religion, political affiliations, and personal characteristics through dress, modern social media users do the same on digital platforms (Shumaker, Loranger, & Dorie, 2017).

Social media allows prominent users to post themselves in the latest, most fashionable, or most expensive styles frequently to present a curated depiction of their lives. While 16th century portraiture featured jewelry, textiles, and certain garment styles as identifiers of wealth, contemporary social media users turn to other methods, such as widely known high-end brands or viral dress trends (Shumaker, Loranger, & Dorie, 2017). In recent years, individuals have also

used their dress identity to showcase their political affiliations or views. Most notably, the pink, Pussy Hats have found prominence on social media as a signifier of membership or support of the feminist movement (V & A, n.d.). This draws direct similarities to the manner that Bianca Maria Sforza's early dress style and Eleonora di Toledo's dress style showed support to their family and home region, over their husband. This study highlights that utilizing visual media to convey one's dress identity is a practice that transcends time, with historic examples seen in the portraiture of these nine women offering insight into the techniques of contemporary, social media users.

### **Limitations**

<span id="page-117-0"></span>This study had several limitations. Access and analysis of the portraiture selected for this study were obtained exclusively online, mostly due to COVID-19, and as such not consistently of the highest quality. The women selected for this project were limited due to access to information about their lives, with several women being removed from the original research list as a result of this lack of information. Additionally, this study was limited by the ability to identify credible portraits of each woman available online. Future researchers can explore other notable and well-chronicled women of Northern and Southern Europe during the Renaissance and other time periods.

### **Recommendations for Future Research**

<span id="page-117-1"></span>Due to the limitations of this research, future scholars could make use of non-digital accessibility to the portraits. Furthermore, future research could expand upon research into each of the women's lives by making use of household inventories, letters, and more. This research could lead the way for more in-depth research of some of the lesser-known known women of the nine analyzed in this study. Additionally, the themes identified in this research could be utilized

in broader research of women's identity conventions through dress in media throughout history. A comparative analysis of one of these nine women with contemporary influential women such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michelle Obama, or Kate Middleton and their respective publicly conveyed dress identity in imagery could be beneficial in informing the ways powerful highprofile women negotiate their identities.

  - a. **Caterina is clothed in this depiction.**
- 21. How are the people oriented (front facing, three-quarter view, profile, or back facing)? Consider what this orientation signifies.
  - a. **Caterina is depicted in a profile. This oreientation was extremely common during this period of the Italian Renaissance when creating portraits. The fact that she is in profile hints at the fact that this is not intended to be a portrait of just St. Catherine, but rather as Caterina Sforza depicted as St. Catherine.**
- 22. What is the gender of each person in the image? Has the artist emphasized gender or obscured it?
  - a. **Caterina is a woman. Her gender is emphasized in several ways, her elaborate hair styling, the bangs on the side that draw attention to her face (and Sforza nose), along with the halo above her head (signifying the St. Catherine association).**
- 23. Consider the posture of the sitter(s). Are they seated, standing, or reclining? Are parts of the body not visible in the image? Is their posture rigid or relaxed? Is posture indicative of state of mind and/or training of the body?
  - a. **It is uncertain if she is sitting or standing as the portrait cuts off the lower half of her body. Her posture seems to be more relaxed as she looks out of the balcony window (?). However, her straight posture and non-slouched shoulders hint at fine breeding that would be akin to that taught to a Sforza daughter.**
- 24. Are other objects or animals included in the image to depict activities, interest, or status,…? How does the sitter engage with these objects?
  - a. **Caterina has her hands on a book that sits on the balcony ledge with one hand and has a matyr palm and wheel (symbols that were associated with St. Catherine) (Stollhans, 2007).**
- 25. Describe the main elements of clothing for each person in the image in detail, noting the garment category and how it is worn. Also note whether any outdoor clothing.
  - a. **Caterina appears to be wearing a white long sleeved gown, a green and red trimmed cloak. The sleeveless zimarra appears to be loosely worn and possible clasped together in the front.**

- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **The type of textiles used in the garments worn by Caterina cannot be named with certainty. The faded red color and green….**
- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?
  - a. **Caterina lacks any embellishment in her dress as she is depicted as a saint. However, here hair has golden ribbon to wrap her hair up.**
- 28. Is any element of dress exaggerated?
  - a. **None of her dress is exaggerated as she is supposed to be depicted mimicking the depiction practices of St. Catherine of Alexandria.**
- 29. Describe the accessories of each person…Note how they are worn, carried, or placed in the image.
  - a. **Caterina appears to have a black thread/ rope around her neck, most likely attached to a crucifix. Her halo can be described as an accessory, however this is the period convention of identifying saints in art. Caterina also holds a handkerchief in her hand alongside the martyr palm.**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **The martyr palm, book, and spiked wheel are signifiers of St. Catherine. However, the book is commonly used as symbolism of knowledge and intellect, personality traits strongly associated with Caterina Sforza. Furthermore, the martyrs palm and spiked wheel are symbolic of strentgth, fortitutde, characteristics also known to be possessed by Caterina Sforza. However, Stollhans (2007) notes that it was uncommon to see depictions of St. Catherine of Alexandria holding all three items.**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **The clothing she wears connects her with the identity and persona of St. Catherine of Alexandria who is sometimes depicted wearing a green and red trimmed mantle/ cloak/ zimarra over a plain long sleeved gown.**
- 32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - a. **Caterina's hair is in an updo similar to other hairstyles she is seen wearing prior to her widowhood. The style has curled side bangs framing her face, and gold ribbon tying up the rest of her hair in a twisted bun behind her head. This is against tradition of St. Catherine because as a saint she was a virgin which was symbolized in her hair being worn down in some style (Stollhans, 2007).**
- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **This is intended to be a realistic image to an extent. The angel/ saint halo hovering over her head is intended to be metaphorical.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **All parts of the painting are distinguishable.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **This artwork fits within the narrative of the High Renaissance/ mannerist/ humanist artistic period. The high attention to the drape of garments, light source, and human anatomy. Specifically, the attention to the realistic**

## **depiction of human anatomy is so well attended to that Caterina/ St. Catherine is even depicted with the signature long angled Sforza nose.**

- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **This painting has exceptionally detailed depth and dimension os space within it. The foreground features Caterina/ St. Catherine with her wheel, martyr palm, and book. The midground extends to the edge of the balcony right to the side of Caterina/ St. Catherine. Then the background includes the Romagna landscape outside of the balcony. The foreground and midground are linked in the sense that they are contained within the same space (the balcony) while the background exists as its own determined space outside of the balcony with no link/ connection.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **Perspective does not appear to be alternated in any notable way.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **The portrait is about the size of a human torso, furthering the feeling of the portrait representing a window that the viewer can look through and see Caterina/ St. Catherine and the Romagna countryside.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **The lines of the balcony position her in a way that she is centered within the corner of the balcony. This creates the illusion that all lines point towards her.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The use of color not only balances the composition (shades of red, green, and white). The lightest colors in the portrait are reserved for Caterina, with her almost golden blonder hair, her golden sun kissed skin, and the cream coloring of her gown. The dark coloring of the balcony ledges aids in framing Caterina's body. In a way it creates a mild chiaroscuro effect. Additionally, the balanced neutral colored landscape of the background allows for there to be distinct figures and buildings within the background without distracting from the focus of the portrait, Caterina.**

## *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **The artist emphasizes the iconography of St. Catherine while also emphasizing the beauty and dress of the woman. The artist does this utilizing color and heightened attention to details such as the creases and folds in her garments, the intricate waved curls of her hair, and the distinct nose shape. The iconography of St. Catherine represents dual meaning as the attributes attached to these objects were desired/ possessed by Caterina.**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **See question #1**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?

- a. **The underlying structure is triangular as the eye is drawn to the halo and the lines and angles of the balcony the way her body is facing and the slant of her breasts all bring together the right angle triangular shape with her back representing the straight side. Futhermore, it should be noted that only manmade structures in the painting feature completely straight lines (the background buildings, the lines of the balcony, etc), while the natural elements (i.e., the trees, mountains, river, Caterina herself).**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **There is an intentional destabilization of the painting. As previously mentioned, Caterina is centered within the portrait as a whole and within the corner of the balcony. The angular nature of the edges of the balcony and their positioning create the illusion that the painting is not symmetrical, and in a way making the overall composition more visually appealing. Caterina's leftward facing body also disrupts the balance of the composition as it creates a very left heavy focus.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The portrait is unified in its balanced color palette and the dynamic in which the various elements interact. The objects in the background are small and diligently detailed enough to be realistic allowing them to provide the back landscape needed to convey the depth of space surrounding Caterina. Caterina's interaction with the different spaces within the painting aid in connecting the different planes within the setting (fore, mid, back). In essence nothing appears to be exceptionally out of place, mis-sized, or mis-focused.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **The artist is trying to express how Renaissance women of this period, Caterina included, may have strived to embody the values of St. Catherine. The possession of St. Catherine's iconographic objects (martyr palm, book, and spiked wheel), represent virtues of knowledge and bravery along with purity and devotion to god.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The choice of medium does not impact the overall painting. However, Botticelli has utilized gold leaf in the halo and possibly in her hair to really add the necessary highlight/ emphasis on these areas.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **Botticelli has used Caterina's calm positioning of her hand casually on the balcony ledge and a book, while calmly gazing into the off canvas background to the left, to convey her status of wealth/ leisure as she is not doing any form of housework or other form of labor indicative of a lower socio-economic class of woman typically depicted in portraiture during the Renaissance.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?

- a. **The dress is relatively consistent for this time period. She wears a sleeveless zimarra and a white long sleeved gown underneath. This apparel, while simple and unadorned (not indicative of Caterina' wealth and status) it would be accurate for a contemperous depiction of Caterina as St. Catherine.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The garments are consistent with period dress for women.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The accessories Caterina is depicted with have religious meaning in relation to the iconography of St. Catherine (martyrs palm, book, and spiked shielf). The outer gown/zimarra that she wears bares resemblance to the mantles St. Catherine is typically seen wearing.**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The garments she wears are worn in a way that conceals the "sexual/ feminine" parts of her body such as her breasts, waist, stomach (which was symbolic of fertility). These body parts are concealed through dress in homage to St. Catherine as she is revered as a devote follower of God and a virgin.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **The artist has taken the liberty of depicting a real woman in the image of St. Catherine, which at the time would have treaded on heretical. However, this visual liberty aims at reflecting the desired virtues of women during his period.**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This artwork was examined as a means to analyze the depiction and dress identity of Caterina Sforza in period portraiture.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **This painting makes me feel serene. The mix of colors and calmness of the scene makes me feel at ease in a way.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My initial personal reaction does not have anything to do with cultural views. However, in reaction to the information I have found on this portrait about the aspirations of aristocratic women to mimic the virtues of a saint, I feel it is quite quaint.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **As previously mentioned, I had been under the impression that Caterina was a brunette (however, this is disproven in her other portraits). Additionally, while some scholars are split on who is depicted in this portrait and a few who debate the artist, from the other information I have collected in relation to Caterina Sforza I believe that this is indeed a portrait of her. The fact that**

**this portrait is dated circa 1475 implies it is directly prior or even after her 1477 marriage.** 

- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **This portrait is a single work.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - a. **Botticelli has made numerous other portraits that are very similar to this one, however those portraits are all of noblemen and noblewomen, not as religious allegories. His religious works typically were landscape scenes or portraits of the Madonna and child.**
  - b. **Works:**
    - **i. Portrait if Esmeralda Bandinelli (possibly c.1471): Signoria Bandinelli is portrayed with a similar hairstyle to Caterina, and the background of her portrait places her in a similar position as Caterina (i.e. centered within an angled corner). As a known married woman Bandinelli's hair is pulled back, this hints to Caterina's identity as a married woman within the portrait having the same hairstyle.**
    - **ii. Portrait of a young woman (possibly circa 1475): This portrait is described as a depiction of famous Botticelli muse and mistress of Giuliano de' Medici mistress, and married noblewoman Simonetta Vespucci. Depicted with her hair pulled back aswell and with a black thread necklace around her neck aswell hints to the period accuracy of Caterina's dress (Salvini, 1965).**
    - **iii. Portrait of a woman, 1481-82: A woman in a simple gown wearing a necklace with her hair pulled back and wearing a veil covering her hair hints at the simpler simplicity in dress seen within this portrait.**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?
  - a. **There have been a number of Botticelli exhibitions over the last two centuries in numerous countries and institutions, too many to in fact count. However, the most objectively relied upon biography of Sandro Botticelli (nee Alessandro Filipepi) was written by Giorgio Vasari in his** *Lives of Artist* **series. Botticelli studied under Fra Filippo Lippi (a noted Florentine painter) , Verrocchio, and was heavily inspired in his early works by Pollaiuolo. He was enlisted by Lorenzo de' Medici for a number of portraits and landscapes. Vasari notes that Botticelli is well known for his depiction of beautiful women and emphasis on facial beauty (Vasari, 1912-1915/1550- 1568; Salvini, 1965). Botticelli's works were also noted for his attention to realistic movement and his advance use of depth within the background of his works without drawing attention away from the main figures depicted. This work most clearly marks his earlier works (those prior to his** *Birth of Venus* **and** *Primavera***) as it does not reflect the high level or ornamented portraiture that he later became noted for (Arasse, 2003). The sense of calm serenity in this painting can be credited to his still being early in his career**

**and heavily influenced by his mentor, as his later works take on a complex sadness. Botticelli is also noted for his dynamic interactions between planes, or having the ability to depict the subject interacting with numerous planes within the painting without distorting the perspective (Salvini, 1965). This is clearly evidenced in this portrait as explained in the analysis above.** 

- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - a. **Botticelli was well known for his highly detailed cartoons (sketches) drawn prior to painting. The sketches were created from life/ designs and then transferred to the final canvas, altarpiece, etc (O'Malley, 2014). As such it is uncertain if this particular portrait was created from live models.**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Outer gown/ zimarra**
  - b. **Quattrocento gowns**
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?
  - a. **Other images of Caterina exist within the bounds of this research, and numerous depictions exist of St. Catherine (although not contemporous).**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **This attention to the attributes of St. Catherine marks a period in which attention to classicism was heightened. As St. Catherine, a princess, was a champion of Christianity in pre-Christian times in Alexandria her story would likely be very popular during this period. Beauty and intelligence in women were becoming seeming valued attributes as they mimicked the characteristics of female saints, ancient women such as Helen of Troy, and aided in the classicism mentality of knowledge (Stollhans, 2007).**

## *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **The combinations of Caterina's own identifying features and those of St. Catherine finding a type of harmony within this composition really stands out to the talent executed by Botticelli. Furthermore, the sereneness of Caterina's demeanor in this painting as a portrait that pre-dates her first husband's assassination stands out as an informative example of her identity prior to her infamous widow persona.**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **The painting aligns with the goals of my research question and conveys an identity/ dress identity owned by Caterina prior to her first husband's assassination.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?

- a. **This work notes how Botticelli was detouring from some of the artistic conventions of the period such as depicting a saint in modern day, and his subsequent landscapes of pagans (i.e.** *Birth of Venus***). However, this trend was popularized at the end of the quattrocento.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **The depiction of fashion in this work lends to the concept that while not every noblewoman dressed as Caterina is depicted in the portait, there was goal of humility, godliness, and a lack of overt sexualness in the dress of noblewomen at the time. Or at least this was the concept that society wanted to convey through the lasting medium or portraiture (regardless of if these dress values were actually practiced or truly desired by women of the period).**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - a. **At the suggested time of the painting of this portrait (c. 1475) Caterina was about to or had recently wed Girolamo Riario in 1477. The evidence of this painting being commissioned after her marriage is present in her dress and hair. As seen in Botticelli's other portraits of aristocratic women and period dress conventions, married women were expected to wear their hair up. As St. Catherine was a virgin, and assumingly Caterina was perceived to be a virgin until her marriage, the fact she is depicted with her hair up lends to the portrait existing after her marriage to Girolamo Riario.**

**Her allegiance with the Riraio family put her in joint control of large territories in Romagna, the hilly countryside near Tuscany, and specifically Imola and Forlì. These territories could be depicted in the background of this portrait, as the landscape bares some resemblance to Imola. The representation of her husband's territories in the background of the painting would represent a kind of pinning as at the time Caterina and Girolamo would have resided in Rome (Hairston, 2000).** 

**Girolamo Riario was a nephew of then Pope Sixtus IV, meaning Caterina effectively married into the papacy. As such there would naturally have been specific expectations of Caterina while she resided in Rome. It would naturally make sense for her to want to adapt the characteristics of St. Catherine of Alexandria. The similarities between the two women do not stop at their names. St. Catherine was the daughter of a king, in the same way Caterina was the daughter of a powerful duke. Caterina's intelligence was noted throughout the Renaissance, with period accounts vilifying her (a response to her perceived threat towards the patriarchal rule of society) in response to her shrewd intelligence in the same way in which St. Catherine was martyred for similar characteristics in the service of Christianity (Pasolini, 1913; Hairston, 2000; de Vries, 2003; Stollhans, 2007). Caterina's alignment with St. Catherine notingly takes away from her more** 

**traditionally emphasized traits of married women during this period (i.e. her breasts, and stomach/ womb). The mantle in which she is dressed in mimics that worn by women of this period, more commonly known as a zimarra or outer gown, but also resembles the mantles in which saints are depicted in religious works. In essence, Caterina's dress choice disguising references to her sexual being highlights her other capabilities, as a highly intellectual women, a non-sexual being, and most importantly for her during this period, a devout woman to God, the Church, and the Pope.**

- 8. Is the work horizontal or vertical in orientation? Consider how this orientation impacts the work.
  - a. **This painting is vertical in orientation, as it is a portrait. The vertical orientation makes it very clear this is a portrait and further it frames Caterina more in the portrait.**
- 9. Has this work been altered in some way from its original state?
  - a. **It is unknown if this painting has been altered.**
- 10. Where is the emphasis in the image?
  - a. **The emphasis is on all the red in the painting, which inevitably frames Caterina within the image.**
- 11. What captures your attention first?
  - a. **I am immediately drawn to the red curtain behind Caterina's head and the red table cloth in front of her.**
- 12. How many persons are included in the artwork?
  - a. **There is one person in this painting.**
- 13. Are the figures in the artwork known persons? Is the work intended as a portrait? Can they be identified by name? If so, this knowledge of their identity inform your analysis?
  - a. **This painting is of Caterina Sforza which informs this analysis as it allows for this researcher to identify key identifiers in relation to her dress and identity preferences related to her lineage and role in society depicted by Credi.**
- 14. If there is more than one person, what is their physical position relative to each other? Does their position, posture, or body language echo their relationship?
  - a. **There is only one person in this portrait.**

- 15. Where is their gaze directed?
  - a. **The gaze of Caterina is slightly directed out towards the viewer but to the right hand side of the painting.**
- 16. Is the setting indoors or outdoors?
  - a. **The portrait setting appears to be on a covered patio.**
- 17. Does the artwork depict a specific place or setting?
  - a. **The background could depict the Imola, in the Romagna region with the countryside in the background (where Caterina would have lived at the time of the painting of this portrait).**
- 18. What elements of the setting or background are notable?
  - a. **The fortress in the background bares similarities with Rocca Sforzesca. The sharp cut out of the moat connecting to the larger moat surrounding the city of Imola can be seen in the background of the painting and in the map below.**

*Map of Imola, 1502, by Leonard Da Vinci, The Royal Collection Trust, RCIN 912284, https://www.rct.uk/collection/912284/a-map-of-imola*

- 19. Does the setting convey status, privilege, or other meaning?
  - a. **The open air covered balcony and curtains on the balcony hints at a level of status and privilege reserved for the upper classes. Additionally, the beautiful view was not one frequently seen in urban settings and would be a privileged view/ environment for wealthy nobles with multi-story fortresses or castles in the countryside.**

- 20. Are the people in the artwork clothed? If not, are the naked bodies ornamented or fashioned in some way?
  - a. **Caterina is clothed.**
- 21. How are the people oriented (front facing, three-quarter view, profile, or back facing)? Consider what this orientation signifies.
  - a. **Caterina is positioned in a 3/4th angle with her back shoulder away from the viewer. She has her head positioned the same way with her eyes tilted in the opposite way. This orientation, a common one in many portraits of the period, can be a hint at the more natural setting in which she is depicted. Instead of having some form of formal aristocratic portrait, the painting appears to capture Caterina in an almost candid scene.**
- 22. What is the gender of each person in the image? Has the artist emphasized gender or obscured it?
  - a. **Caterina is a woman in which her gender is played up in several ways in this portrait. Her hair hangs in a way that frames her face in which she can said to have warm honey colored eyes. Furthermore, the stomacher insert she wears and the lacing of her gown across her bosom draws attention to this feminine organ. Additionally, the fact that Caterina is organizing the flowers (jasmine according to one of the titles) in the bowl in front of her, a typically feminine domestic activity of noblewomen, adds to her feminine and domestic persona in the painting.**
- 23. Consider the posture of the sitter(s). Are they seated, standing, or reclining? Are parts of the body not visible in the image? Is their posture rigid or relaxed? Is posture indicative of state of mind and/or training of the body?
  - a. **Caterina is sitting in a position that is slightly slouched, but this could be due to her being "captured" in movement as she arranges the flowers in the bowl. She is seated at a table so the bottom half of her gown is not visible. Caterina was raised at the Sforza Milanese court as the illegitimate daughter of the Galeazza and her mother…… Landriani, as such she was given a formal education befitting a noblewoman in which the pose depicted in this painting would be expected of her ( ). Her sloped shoulders lack a bit of realism based on the angle of the slope, but this posture (less exaggerated) could be achieved to some extent due to the dress hanging close off the shoulders.**
- 24. Are other objects or animals included in the image to depict activities, interest, or status,…? How does the sitter engage with these objects?
  - a. **Caterina is clearly arranging flowers in the painting. Such as pastime was akin to embroidery and other feminine activities for noblewomen of the time. Caterina's fingers are depicted in mid motion as she plucks one flower from the bowl with one hand and seeks a place to replace it with the other hand.**
- 25. Describe the main elements of clothing for each person in the image in detail, noting the garment category and how it is worn. Also note whether any outdoor clothing.
  - a. **Caterina wear a simple blue gown with and camicia underneath, and a green stomacher. The camicia is visible in the distinct slashings on the sleeves of her gown that are held together with lacing. The camicia bursting from the sleeve slashing greats a puffed and voluminous decorative effect to the otherwise**

**unadorned sleeves. The camicia is also visible peaking out of her neckline. She also wears a red belt (girdle) tied at the center of her waist.** 

- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **The type of textiles present in the painting can not be accurately determined. However, the camicia can be approximated be made of linen as this was a common material for camicia during the period. The outer dress is blue, the camicia is white, the stomacher is green with a black band at the top.**
- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?
  - a. **The clothing Caterina wears is only embellished with the red ties/ lacing.**
- 28. Is any element of dress exaggerated?
  - a. **The shape the gown makes around the stomacher is a bit exaggerated as the fabric lacks any wrinkles/ puckering, which would occur as stretch fabrics did not exist yet.**
- 29. Describe the accessories of each person…Note how they are worn, carried, or placed in the image.
  - a. **The bowl of flowers can be perceived to be an accessory. However, it is slightly odd that Caterina is wearing no jewelry (no necklace, rings, hair pins, etc).**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **There are no signifiers such as the ones listed above. However, the jasmine flowers in the bowl may have meaning as according to one title of the painting Caterina was known as the Lady of Jasmine. Caterina was known during her time for her skill in alchemy, and jasmine is know for its various healing properties (Lifson, 2017).**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **The lack of elaborateness and lack of jewels in this portrait is ODD.**
- 32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - a. **Caterina is depicted with a little bit of pink blush on her cheeks. Her hair is pulled back in a bun with sections parted off and hanging curled and loose towards the front of her head.**
- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **This is a realistic image.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **There does not appear to be any unfinished or indistinguishable elements of this painting.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **This painting fits within Italian High Renaissance painting techniques of the late 15th and early 16th century. The attention to detail in the depiction of every strand of hair and the shading of the body and face is consistent with the time. Furthermore, the shading and creases seen on the sleeves of her dress and the camicia are notable signs of the realism pursued by Renaissance painters such as Credi.**

- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **The artist has a good grasp on defining space. There is a clear foreground (the red covered table, her arm, and the bowl of flowers), a mid ground (extends from Caterina to the balcony ledge), and background (the entire landscape beyond the balcony setting). The foreground and mid ground are tied together as Caterina interacts with each of these spaces. However, the background exists as its own entity almost like a picture window. Each of these spaces is intentional and literal, most likely representing real physical spaces, regardless of if these spaces were present when Credi was painting Caterina.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **The perspective is distorted in several places. The first is Caterina's shoulders. Her shoulders are sloped at an angle far too steep for a real human, possibly in an effort to foreground her shoulder that is facing towards the viewer. Additionally the foliage on the trees in the background is far too detailed for how far away it would have been in real life, this can also be said for the highly in focus and detailed Rocca Sforzesca in the background.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **The artwork is relatively small, about 1/3 of human size. In a way, it gives the feeling of a lot being "crammed" into such a small painting.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **Caterina is framed in the center of the portrait however furniture and architecture within the painting aid in further bringing the eye back to her. The pillar behind Caterina to the right of the painting provides a line between the background and the curtain that effectively "stops" the eye, while the red curtain perfectly frames Caterina's face and compliments her lighter shade of golden hair. The line of the balcony ledge allows for the area behind Caterina's torso to remain plain, dark, and without further colored background elements to distract the eye. This yet again draws the viewer's eyes to Caterina.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The use of red in numerous places aids in guiding the eye from Caterina's head (golden hair[according to Brewer, 1970], red curtain background), her torso (red lacings on her gown), to her hands on the table (red table). Additionally the Rocca Sforzesca and the dirt road, in the background stands out in its grey and brown on the otherwise predominantly green and blue background landscape.**

## *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **Credi visually emphasized Caterina and the castle in the background. Theses two elements and their shared emphasis along with the color red are not by**

**accident or personal preference. The abundance of red is a nod to the Catholic church and the pope who gifted Caterina and her then husband dominon over Imola and subsequently Forli. The castle in the background could be Rocca Sforzesca, the castle Caterina would have resided in upon her arrival in Imola in the early 1480s.**

- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc? a. **See Observation questions #40 and #39**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **The color red present throughout the painting creates a rhythm and balance that aids in guiding the eye. All of the key red elements in the painting are purposely centered within the composition, allowing for the sides (the space to the left of the red curtain and the space to the right of the red curtain and pillar) to offer brightness. Unlike other Renaissance paintings and portraits, this painting seems to take on a rectangular geometric structure, utilizing the rectangle of the red curtain and the rectangle of the red covered table that sits in front of her, and the square/ rectangles that make up the space looking out into the background. The only large distinct objects without four sides are Caterina and her gown and sleeves, along with the green bushes and tree tops in the background.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **While Caterina herself is centered the composition appears to be purposely off centered in a way. The pillar on the right of the painting gives the viewer the illusion that Caterina is not centered in the composition, this paired with her ¾ pose and the partially drawn back red curtain all create this illusion of off balance that is aesthetically more pleasing than if Caterina were to be depicted in the center of the painting looking straight ahead. Furthermore, the fact that the bowl of flowers is placed on the left side of the painting ties the composition back together as it creates a kind of diagonal motion (the background space on the right, then Caterina, then the bowl of flowers). The bowl of flowers brings a color balance to the painting as the bowl and the flowers in it are of a similar color scheme as the natural background outside the balcony setting tying together the otherwise dark scheme within the balcony.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **While at first glance the painting seems slightly separated, the spaces all interact and tie together utilizing color, line, and space. Credi uses the concepts of foreground, middle ground, and background to separate te different elements of the painting, but successfully ties it back together in a way that strategically leads the viewer's eyes to what he wants to emphasize. See questions #3 and 4 for more.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **I think Credi is trying to emphasize the success granted to a dutiful wife and loyal follower of the Pope and the Church. This is conveyed in the prominent**

**featuring of Caterina and her husband's assumed castle and principality in the background, along with her simple and humble style of dress, and the domestic feminine task she is conducting in the portrait.** 

- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **No. Credi painted this portrait as it was tradition to paint portraits during this period. Credi does not appear to use and difficult to obtain paint colors or incorporate gold leaf into the painting.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **As previously mentioned Caterina's leisurely activity of arranging flowers on her balcony that overlooks her castle is a clear definition of her status as an aristocrat. A woman of a lower social class would not have time for such a leisurely activity nor have a view such as the one depicted. If she were a man she would not be arranging flowers as this was considered a feminine pastime.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **The dress of Caterina in this painting is not at all consistent with her class (but is consistent with her age and gender), as it is overall too simplistic to be worn by a granddaughter of the Duke of Milan and a member of the Sforza family. She lacks the elaborate textiles and jewels noted to be worn by women in her family, including her half-sisters and step-mother ( ). This is not to mention at the time this portrait was created she was the niece in law of Pope Sixtus IV (Pasolini, 1913).**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The gown's stomacher/modesty piece is more akin to the early 15th century/ late middle ages in style, yet the slashed sleeves is distinctly an Italian Renaissance style (Tortora & Marcketti, ). The simpleness of the fabric used in her gown is also inconsistent for the period when taking into account her status and wealth.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The use of red lacings and her red belt can be in reference to red being a symbolic color of Christianity and the Catholic Church. Her simple style could also play into religion as she could be aiming to depict herself in a humble and pious manner akin to the Virgin Mary, unadorned domesticity.**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The tightness of her bodice showcases her breasts in a conservative manner, while her fitted shirt sleeves appear to explode from the body in the areas with slashing in which the camicia blouses out. Caterina is depicted in a gown that covers large portions of her body with the only part revealed with the table in front of her is her hands and the area around her collar bone.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.

- a. **Her shoulders are sloped at an angle far too steep for a real human, possibly in an effort to foreground her shoulder that is facing towards the viewer. Additionally, from the angle of the viewer her waist appears to be as wide as her head. She also has an elongated neck, which could be a real depiction or an artistic convention to meet period beauty standards (Birth of Venus by Botticelli, Venus has a very long neck).**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This artwork depicted Caterina Sforza and resides in the collection in Forli (her notorious home). The depiction showcases her at the beginning of her first marriage, and depicts her rather simply for a Sforza daughter.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **My emotive reaction is confusion. This painting appeals to me as it serves as a mystery. So many why questions. Why doesn't she have any jewelry on? Why is she in a gown that objectively is 50+ years off trend? Why is she in a gown that is so simple? Why the blue flowers? This painting reminds me of Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary in period dress, or noblewomen having their likeness depicted as the Virgin Mary or as goddesses.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My personal reactions indicate that cultural dress beliefs have shifted, not just from the time period I analyze this painting from but within the time period Caterina lived.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I had the preconception that Caterina Sforza was a brunette and the antithesis of the subservient domestic wife. Any depiction of her she is described as a super intense person self-centered person.**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **This work appears to be a stand alone painting.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - a. **Credi has created numerous other half body portraits (including a self portrait) (Brewer, 1970)**
    - i. **La Giovane Vedova (1488-90): noble woman w/ round bushes in background; similar face shape and chin to Caterina's depiction**
    - **ii. Bust of Boy with Red Beret ( ): Similar window to natural landscape background on left side of portrait with trees and a waterfall; uses sfumato in the background to blend the water and trees; similar face shape and chin to Caterina's depiction**
    - **iii. Portrait of a Man ( ): Window on the left with field of trees and round bushes**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?

- a. **Vasari (1550 or 1568) along with Brewer (1970) offer insight into the life and art. Credi, a pupil of Andrea Verrocchio (a peer of Leonardo da Vinci), mimicked the styles of his two famous mentors. The faces of Credi's female portraits are very similar to that of Da Vinci's (Vasari, 1550-1568). So much so that there was much debate surrounding the similarities between Da Vinci's portrait of Ginevra d'Amerigo dei Benci and Credi's La Giovane Vedova (Brewer, 1970). This painting of Caterina showcases Credi's noted intentionality and care with colors (Brewer, 1970; Vasari, 1550 -1568). Of note is his use of green and greenery in the background of his works, which is especially evident in this portrait with it's elaborate landscape.**
- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - a. **Credi is noted as having created sketch as preparatory studies before creating a painting or altarpiece (Brewer, 1970; Vasari, 1550-1568). Aside from this information he was noted for conducting sketch studies with clay models in his early career, but it is unknown what his practices were at the time of this portrait (Vasari, 1550-1568).**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Gown**
  - b. **Slashing**
  - c. **Camicia**
  - d. **Stomacher**
  - e. **Modesty piece**
  - f. **Girdle/Belt**
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?
  - a. **Yes, see other selected paintings. Caterina is depicted differently in the numerous other depictions of her.**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **This painting based on the date could possibly mark the rule of Caterina and her first husband over Imola and Forli, gifted from Pope Sixtus IV (Pasolini, 1913). If anything this painting reinforces gender expectations of the time of noblewomen (i.e. pious, beautiful, the epitome of domesticity).**

## *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **The abundance of red in the portrait sticks out as well as the prominence of the castle in the background. Furthermore, the simplistic dress of Caterina does not fit her status and is slightly out of style for the period. The jasmine flowers also stand out as a powerful representation of Caterina's prowess with herbs and in a way foreshadows her reputation for alchemy and poisons.**

- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This portrait inspires curiosity as it offers many elements to research in relation to my existing research question.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **This portrait speaks to the portrait conventions of the period and of Credi's artistic style influenced by such period masters as his mentor Verrocchio and Da Vinci. The heightened richness of color and the detailed landscape not only speak to Credi's talent but to the overall richness of colors becoming ever-present in High Renaissance works of art during this time.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.

**As the daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza and his mistress Lucrezia Landriani Caterina was born (1462/1463), yet she was legitimized by her father, allowing her the social mobility akin to her half-sisters (her father's legitimate daughters from his marriage) (de Vries, 2010). As noted by Pasolini (1913) and Hairston (2000) in evidence from letters written to her father, Caterina was incredibly intelliegent and tutored alongside her brothers, a possible explanation for her inclination to alchemy and the healing arts, as conveyed in the portrait by her interactions with the bowl of jasmine. Caterina would have been raised in one of the most opulent courts in Europe from her birth until her first marriage to Girolamo Riario in 1477 (Pasolini, 1913). This portrait could have been painted anytime from 1480 until 1490 (de Vries, 2010; ). As such this would be a period in which Caterina and her husband had recently been granted control over Forlì in addition to Girolamo's jurisdiction over Imola (granted by his uncle Pope Sixtus IV) (Hairston, 2000; Pasolini, 1913; de Vries, 2010). The Rocca Sforzesca, the fortress in which she resided with Girolamo during their time in Imola, is recognizable. Additionally, depending on the actual date of this portrait this could be a time after Girolamo's assassination on April 14, 1488, which subsequently resulted in the kidnapping of Caterina and the rest of her family in Forlì. The story first recounted by Machievelli in his writings the** *Discourses***, the** *Florentine Histories***, and briefly in the** *Prince***, describes Caterina refusing to surrender to her captors, and upon threat to her children she supposedly lifts her skirts for the crowd below to see her female genitalia claiming she could always have more children (Hairston, 2000). This would have been an apt statement and philosophy to live by as she is depicted in the painting sans her children, despite at the time of this portrait potentially having three to seven children at the time (de Vries, 2010). In this painting Caterina plays up domestic ssimplicity in her dress, being unadorned in simple dress that would be more akin to aristorcratic woman of earlier in the century or of a pleasant at that time. Her overall unbefitting dress of her status allows other aspects of the portrait to be of greater focus. The abundance of red in the portrait hints at the papal protection and support she received as Countess of Imola and Forlì, and after her husband's assassination. Additionally, the**

**presence of the fortress in the background speaks more to her political power, power atypical of an aristocratic woman of the period. Then the portait draws the viewer back to her more traditional feminine pursuits as she interacts with the jasmine flowers hinting at her powerful mind and talents with alchemy, and rumored poisons ( ).**

- 21. How are the people oriented (front facing, three-quarter view, profile, or back facing)? Consider what this orientation signifies.
  - a. **Both Caterina and Giovanni are in ¾ positioning angled towards each other. This positioning can be indicative of their relationship as husband and wife as they look towards each other seemingly lovingly.**
- 22. What is the gender of each person in the image? Has the artist emphasized gender or obscured it?
  - a. **Giovanni is make and Caterina is female. Caterina's gender is emphasized through her dress (which will be elaborated on later).**
- 23. Consider the posture of the sitter(s). Are they seated, standing, or reclining? Are parts of the body not visible in the image? Is their posture rigid or relaxed? Is posture indicative of state of mind and/or training of the body?
  - a. **Both of the individuals are standing, with their hands interacting with elements around them.**
- 24. Are other objects or animals included in the image to depict activities, interest, or status,…? How does the sitter engage with these objects?
  - a. **Caterina is depicted with one hand over her heart and the other holding a handkerchief at her side. This could be indicative of some sort of widow ritual. Giovanni is depicted with a letter in one hand and the other hand leaning on the desk next to him, signaling her could have been in the midst of writing the letter before the portrait.**
- 25. Describe the main elements of clothing for each person in the image in detail, noting the garment category and how it is worn. Also note whether any outdoor clothing.
  - a. **Caterina is wearing a black gown with long sleeves that are laced into the armhole, and has a black and white lined veil over her head and hair. Giovanni is wearing a long pink/red jacket with ermine trim.**

- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **The type of textiles can not be definitively identified due to the quality of the digitalized images of the painting. Caterina is in all black a period symbol for death and mourning, a possible nod towards her numerous widowhoods.**
- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?
  - a. **Caterina's gown appears to be unembellished aside from the laced up armhole, she also remains unadorned in terms of jewelry.**
- 28. Is any element of dress exaggerated?
  - a. **The clear miscoloring of Giovanni's jacket is exaggerated, but this is more likely due to restoration efforts than the artists design.**
- 29. Describe the accessories of each person…Note how they are worn, carried, or placed in the image.
  - a. **Caterina wears a veil over her head, and carries a handkerchief, while Giovanni is wearing/ carrying no dress accessory.**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **The fur on Giovanni's jacket, most likely an ermine fur based on its appearance, which is a fur relegated to being wore exclusively by royalty during this period due to its expensive nature to create.**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **Caterina's dress distinctly identifies her as a widow of the upper classes, while she does not have any jewelry to depict her identity, we do know that she is wearing the period appropriate garments for mourning. In contrast, her husband wears the trims of a royal and appears to be conducting business affairs (by the letter in his hand).**
- 32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - a. **Caterina is free of makeup and her hair is hidden behind her veil. Giovanni has his hair down and shoulder length.**
- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **This image is intended to be realistic.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **Due to the quality of digital images available the background is mostly indistinguishable.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **The painting definetly fits within the Italian Renaissance late mannerist movement, in the careful depictions of the folds and light source showcased in this painting. Furthermore, Sciorina utilizes chiaroscuro a traditional Italian painting technique from this period.**
- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **There is a mild sense of space in this work. Giovanni stands in the foreground with his hand on a table that represents the mid-ground, while he turns inwards towards Caterina who stands in the slight background**

**(although arguably the wall behind her represents the furthest most point in the background.** 

- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **Perspective does not appear to be alternated or distorted in any specific way.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **The painting canvas is a little smaller than what would be life sized for the figures depicted. While digitally this does not affect how viewers perceive the painting, in real life I could imagine the painting comes off in a kind of foreboding with the dark colors and serious facial expression.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **Caterina and Giovanni take up a large portion of the canvas, not leaving much space for anything else. However, the table that Giovanni leans on allows there to be an off centered sense of space. The foreground and background nature of Giovanni and Caterina's interactions create intimate positioning within the seemingly confined space. The colored line of Giovanni's jacket creates distinctly characterized space between the two individuals. The line of the corner of the wall behind Giovanni's head further creates this type of lined distinction. The edge of the canvas is used to frame up Caterina's right side virtually pushing Caterina's form between the canvas and her husband.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The color of Giovanni's jacket/robe draw the viewer's attention to him first, and Caterina second. This emphasis is most likely due to the fact this portrait was commissioned to showcase influential members of the Medici family. The paleness of Caterina's face directly contrasts with her stark black mourning clothes, in a way creating a chiaroscuro effect that aids in focusing on her face. While the black mourning attire brings about emotions of sadness, her bright white face can be associated with light and hope, possibly for the Medici future (as her son by Giovanni is the ancestor of the Medici dukedom).**

*Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - b. **See Observation question #40**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **The artist uses color to emphasize Giovanni's dress, and heighten attention to Caterina's face. See Observation question #40 for more.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **During this period of art history specific geometric structures (i.e. triangular) were utilized in portraits. However, none of these are present in this painting. Both Giovanni and Caterina, while standing on relatively different planes are depicted at about the same height, thus eliminating the staggered triangular positioning traditionally seen in Renaissance portraiture.**

- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **The artist has created a destabilized composition that creates a deliberate intimacy between Giovanni and Caterina. While this could depict intimacy it could also refer to the hierarchy in their relationship (Giovanni as a Medici patriarch, and Caterina as a multi-widow and legitimazed daughter of the Duke of Milan). The composition is also notably very right content heavy.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The two figures of Caterina and Giovanni present as rather unified in their depicted very close interaction. The angled nature of both of their arms, along with the fact that both of them are holding an object in their right hands showcases further unity in the composition.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **I believe Sciorina is trying to convey the intimacy and relationship of Caterina and Giovanni. Furthermore he wants to convey Caterina's status as a widow.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The choice of medium impacts the work as it aligns with the primary choice of medium for portraits during the Renaissance.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The artist conveys these things as Giovanni seems to be mid movement as he reads a letter/ bill/ etc while Caterina holds her handkerchief and hand over her heart as she looks adoringly at her husband. The fact that she does not have any other objects she interacts with or activities that she may be doing hints at her depiction as a loving and devoted aristocratic wife.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **In life Caterina would not have worn the dress of a widow as Giovanni was her third husband and still alive (de Vries, 2010). However, this painting was commissioned and completed after her death, and the depiction of Caterina is based off another depiction created of Caterina shortly after Giovanni's death. Sciorina did not take any of these facts into account, and as depicted Caterina as the devoted wife that is actually dressed like a devoted widow, despite her husband being "alive" in this portrait ( "Rittratto di Giovanni," n.d.).**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **Historians theorize that Sciorina took inspiration of his depiction of the late Giovanni from Filippo Lippi's** *Adoration fo the Magi* **which was completed in 1496, two years prior to Giovanni's death. As such, and in conjunction with visual comparisons of dress of that period in Italy, Giovanni's dress is accurate. However, there is debate on the origin for inspiration of Caterina. The** *Catalogo Generale dei Beni Culturali* **describes the inspiration possibly originating from a Francesco Cotignola portrait as Cotignola was residing in**

**Florence at the time ("Rittratto di Giovanni," n.d.). Opposingly, and most convincingly, de Vries (2010) describes the inspiration for Caterina's depiction originating from Giorgio Vasari's popular portrait of the widow Caterina de Medici (nee Sforza) which was created between 1556 and 1559 ("Vasari Giorgio, Ritratto," n.d.). As such the garments are not accurate for the period in which they were painted (1585) but is consistent for the periods in which Giovanni and Caterina respectively lived.** 

- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The style Giovanni is wearing is a more formal robe trimmed in fur reserved for being worn in formal occasions (as seen copied from the Lippi painting**  *Adoraation of the Magi***). As the author took this inspiration from a painting in which the legacy of the Medici family was depicted within a contemporary set Biblical scene his robe brings about implications of regalness and wealth. Caterina is depicted in a manner that has cultural and iconic reference as in numerous of her depictions later in life she is depicted as a widow. As following the death of Giovanni she had been widowed three times (Following the deaths of Giacomo Feo and Giovanni de Medici Caterina claimed to have been married to each man, despite making no such claims during their lives; Historians suspect these claims were made to ensure the inheritance of each of her sons by both men) in her life (de Vries, 2003; de Vries, 2010). This is a fact also up for debate as numerous accounts throughout history suggest that Caterina was an extremely clever poison mistress and as such assassin (Hairston, 2000).**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **Caterina's dress hides her body, in a way de-sexualizing her appearance, even with the nun-like veil, as mourning rituals of this period typically expected recently widowed women to stay out of social life and seek solace in the church as they mourned their husband.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **The artist's copying/ inspiration for the depiction of Caterina and Giovanni indicates liberties already. However, as these depictions were created after their death it is not likely that he would have taken liberties on a depiction he already had to base off of another artist's depiction of these individuals. In essence there are no readily apparent liberties taken in the depiction.**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This painting aligns with research interest and research questions.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **The subservient manner in which Caterina is depicted, especially considering her prolific reputation throughout her life, is almost disrespectful and appalling.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?

- a. **In a way my emotions do indicate how societal views have changed. While in a number of portraits of Caterina have depicted subtle messages of her power and strength akin to that described by Machiavelli, even more of the lasting depictions of her into the 18th century depict her as a widow, instead of the cunning strategist and survivor she actually was.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I have previously learned about Caterina Sforza in a positive feminist context (i.e. as a single woman, warrior, strategist, and diplomat). Having to focus on her life as a wife and widow forces me to confront this one sided depiction of her.**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **This is part of a series that depicts the Medici heritage, and includes 26 other portraits commissioned by Francesco de Medici (Caterina's great-grandson) between 1584 and 1585 (de Vries, 2010).**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - a. **The artist was not highly noted during this period for his work, but rather as a student of Bronzino, primarily assisting in studio projects under his mentor (Vasari, 1912-1915/1550-1568). However, many surviving works attributed to Sciorina are primarily landscape or biblical scenes, as such there can be no comparisons drawn between them.**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?
  - a. **The artist was not exceptionally popular but identified by Vasari as having artistic promise (Vasari, 1912-1915/1550-1568). He is not widely studied or mentioned in research, museums, or exhibitions due to his obscurity. It can be implied that his lack of popularity can be attributed to being overshadowed by more popular Bronzino pupils such as Alessandro Allori, who was the same age as Sciorina.**
- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - a. **In this portrait he used none of the aforementioned methods, and instead based his depictions off of previous depictions of Caterina and Giovanni created while the two were still alive.**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Veil**
  - b. **Mourning dress**
  - c. **Ermine fur**
  - d. **Robe**
  - e. **Tied-in sleeves at armscye**
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?

- a. **Caterina is depicted on medallions and sketches throughout her life and death wearing a mourning veil and the garb of a widow. See de Vries (2003) for images.**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **This garment does not note any such shift as it was created specifically to reenforce gendered stereotypes amongst aristocratic marriages.**

## *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **Caterina's depiction as a widow still sticks in my head. However, De Vries provides an in depth explanation to the rationale behind the idea that Caterina herself was okay with this depiction in many ways. Also Sciorina's artistic abilities later in his life are not no par with what Vasari described as promising, and his composition shows it.**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **After all of the research I have done on Sciorina and this portrait, the one reaction I have is anger. It is in essence not an original composition (how could it be as it is a post humous composition), however Sciorina essentially copied the exact depictions of Caterina and Giovanni from two depictions from distinctly different periods in the two individual's lives. These copied individuals are even wearing the same clothes! This painting does provide a very interesting example for my research questions.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **Frankly, this work shows that Sciorina got lazy in his "old age" and lacks the skills taught to him by his mentor and all around one of the most celebrated artists of the Renaissance if not the entire pre-modern era, Bronzino. His work lacks the clarity and intense attention to detail as that of his other 16th century peers.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **The dress worn by Caterina informs us that even dress as simplistic as a black dress and mourning veil has power.**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - **a. Caterina Sforza (1463-1509), born into the Sforza empire as the illegitimate daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and Lucrezia Landriani, was raised in one of the most affluent courts of the time (de Vries, 2003). Having been legitimized, in 1477 she was married to Girolamo Riario, a nephew of then Pope Sixtus IV (Hairston, 2000). Her first marriage produced seven children before her**

**husband was assassinated in April of 1488. Following the infamous siege of Forlì (mentioned above), Caterina maintained the appearance of a widow, as she acted as regent for her eldest son Ottaviano who was only 9 years old at the time of his father's death. Caterina's shrewd and cunning diplomat as she ruled Forlì and Imola and protected them from domestic and foreign invasions. Machevelli even features Caterina in a number of his writings depicting her as the cunning, cold, woman that would let her children die to protect her rule of Romagna. Despite this impressive resume, she maintained the garb of a widow in official depictions of herself including a selfcommissioned coin following the approval of her regency in 1488 (de Vries, 2003). Period accounts of the Forlì siege highlight this value of her regency over her children as Caterina is said to have claimed that if the captors wished to kill her children they could as she could always have another (although some accounts claim she said she was pregnant) (Hairston, 2000). This in conjunction with the rumors surrounding the murders of two of her spouses and the early death of the third do not appear to add up to the loyal and devoted widow persona that Caterina continuously portrayed. However, De Vries (2017), highlights the fact that her widow persona was directly tied to her identity as regent of Forlì and Imola. In maintaining the appearance of a widow and then "single" matron throughout her life she asserted her power and legitimacy to rule, (which she maintained even after her eldest son came of age). The depiction of Caterina as a widow in this painting takes from a depiction of her following the death of her third husband Giovanni Pier Francesco de' Medici. In opposition to previous depictions of her, she lacks any identifying features of who she is mourning, as he is "alive" right next to her. While Sciorina's depiction of Caterina mourning her "alive" husband lacks common sense, in a way it unintentionally lends to narrative established by Caterina in 1488: perception is power, and power is communicated through dress. Following Giovanni's death Caterina was now mother to the only male son of Giovanni, as a result, Caterina became the grandmother of the next leading power in the Medici family, Cosimo I de' Medici, the first Duke of Tuscany, and husband to Eleonora di Toledo. So despite Sciorina's intentions to depict Caterina in a subservient light, her dress still communicates the manner in which Caterina established her own lasting identity as a powerful woman in life, and inadvertently in death as well.**

This can be viewed as a very regal or imperial choice as many Roman Emperors and other high-ranking aristocrats were frequently depicted in profile, especially on coins. This profile position signifies not only wealth, but part of her regal status as the daughter of one of the most powerful dukedoms in Europe at the time.**
- 22. What is the gender of each person in the image? Has the artist emphasized gender or obscured it?
  - a. **Bianca is a woman. Her femineity his especially emphasized in the elaborateness in which her hair is decorated and the abundance of pearls she is wearing.**
- 23. Consider the posture of the sitter(s). Are they seated, standing, or reclining? Are parts of the body not visible in the image? Is their posture rigid or relaxed? Is posture indicative of state of mind and/or training of the body?
  - a. **From her profile position she appears to be sitting up exceptionally straight, with her head held high with no slouching, and her arms sat at her side. This very formal and elegant posture is indicative of a high class upbringing in which etiquette lessons would have included.**
- 24. Are other objects or animals included in the image to depict activities, interest, or status,…? How does the sitter engage with these objects?
  - a. **There appears to be a red flower in her girdle on the side. This could be indicative of her affinity to flowers or possibly a Sforza emblem.**
- 25. Describe the main elements of clothing for each person in the image in detail, noting the garment category and how it is worn. Also note whether any outdoor clothing.
  - a. **Bianca is wearing a brocade gold overgown, a white camicia underneath the overgown, her sleeves feature period slashing in which the camicia is visible, and her sleeve is tied into the shoulder seam with black ribbons.**
- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **The base fabric of Bianca's gown appears to be some form of brocade (possibly velvet due to the specific brush marks that indicate a pile weave), while her camicia is most likely made of white silk or linen. In Bianca's brocade gown there are a number of natural elements including the symbolic**

**motif of pomegranate (there are three of them depicted together on tree stumps in numerous places) and the ogee lattice.** 

- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?
  - a. **It appears that Bianca's gown is possibly embroidered or brocade, however her headdress features an abundance of pearls, diamonds, and other jewels.**
- 28. Is any element of dress exaggerated?
  - a. **No element of dress appears to be exaggerated.**
- 29. Describe the accessories of each person…Note how they are worn, carried, or placed in the image.
  - a. **Bianca is wearing an elaborate headdress with gold floral shaped metal netting embellished with pearls, diamonds and other gemstones. One cluster of jewels that hangs over her left ear has a piece of cloth wrapped intwined with the group of jewels that says "merito et tempore [With merit and time]" a Sforza motto. This headdress sits halfway back on her head and appears to connect to the string of white and grey pearls that wrap around gold fabric that encases her body length ponytail. She also wears a plain black string ferronière (possibly in which the grouping of jewels is attached to), which is tied to her head with the excess string hanging down to her left shoulder. Bianca is also wearing a white pearl necklace with two jewels (one rectangular and black, and the other orange and circular) hanging off with a large oval pearl at the end which sits on the collar of her dress. She also appears to be wearing another black string necklace underneath this more elaborate one, which disappears underneath the neckline of her gown, possibly hinting at a crucifix necklace. Finally, Bianca appears to be wearing a jeweled girdle with a red carnation flower tucked into it. The girdle features a pattern of four pearls surrounding a larger rectangular stone imposed on a gold circular mount.**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **The inclusion of her family motto on her headdress is a large visible signifier of her status as part of the Sforza family. Furthermore, the truly abundant jewelry Bianca is wearing in this painting hints at a high level of wealth and status. The red carnation tucked into Bianca's girdle showcases her identity as a bride (or soon to be bride), as the carnation in Northern Italian art during this period was symbolic for marriage (Meagher, 2007).**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **The clothing serves as a marker of her identity as the daughter of a very wealthy and of high social standing (Duke of Milan) man.**
- 32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - a. **Bianca is depicted with her hair in a wrapped jeweled ponytail (this style is known as the coazzone braid), and loosely hanging hair on the side of her face that covers her ear (Welch, 2009). De Predis depicts a few stray hairs from the others that fall at an angle down her left cheek. Bianca does not appear to be wearing any makeup, and her eyebrows appear almost transparent (possibly a result of her correspondingly auburn/ red hair).**
- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?

- a. **This is a realistic image.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **The painting appears to be complete in all aspects.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **This painting fits within the beginning of the High Renaissance emphasis on humanism that corresponds to artistic interests in classicalism (a possible explanation of the profile portrait). The high level attention to the details of her dress, the distinct light source (from the left pointing directly onto her face), and the realistic depiction of the human body are all characteristic of art during this period that are visually present in this portrait.**
- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **There is no distinguishable background as it is all black. This choice creates a distinct foreground, in which Bianca sits in profile, and a distinct background, the space to the right of Bianca in the space of the portrait. The sense of space around Bianca is indeterminate as it is all blacked out, so the viewer must draw conclusions about the blacked-out background. This in itself draws questions about the actuality of a physical black background existing at the time Bianca sat for the portrait.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **Perspective does not appear to be altered in a specific or major way.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **The size of the portrait is closer to 1/3 of human size. In a way depending on how tall Bianca was this portrait could be close to life sized. As this is a speculated marriage request portrait it is possible that this was intended to be as close to realistic of her size as possible. Furthermore, the size of the painting and the orientation in which Bianca sits creates the effect of the viewer turning to the side and seeing Bianca seated next to them.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **Due to the blacked-out background the only framing of the body occurring in this portrait is through the bounds of the campus. The choice of utilizing chiaroscuro to focus on Bianca is a straightforward use of the technique in portraiture. In essence, the way in which the body is situated in blackness achieves the portrait's purpose, to focus on Bianca's appearance.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The use of golds, blacks, and whites highlights numerous aspects of her dress while in many ways sidelining her facial appearance (possibly purposeful as her appearance was noted as not being the most beautiful (Rill, 1968). The use of white in the pearls all down her ponytail, around her neck and on her headpiece draws the viewer's eyes from the front of her face moving all the way down her back. As similar effect is seen with the stark black, orange/brown jewels, and white pearls on her girdle. The colors create a**

**slight contrast from her gown and help in leading the eye to the red flower tucked into the belt. Finally, the color white is similarly utilized on her camicia which is depicted coming out of her tied and attached sleeve. This color in the midst of brocaded gold and black ribbons creates a sense of color balance with her pale skin.** 

### *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **The artist is emphasizing the ornamentation Bianca is wearing. It is easily assumed that the artist did this as the intended recipients of the portrait would most likely care more about the wealth and political connections Bianca could bring to their court and less about her beauty. However, beauty of a intended bride was still an important factor for many aristocratic men (at least those that could afford to care), and this could be the motivation behind De Predis depicting Bianca in profile as she was not considered to be exceptionally beautiful (Rill, 1968).**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **The artist emphasized this utilizing color (as explained in Observation question #40) and a heightened attention to the rendering of her expense brocade gown, and numerous jewels. In a way he also utilizes scale to emphasize other elements of her dress over her own physical facial features. Her jeweled headdress that appears to connect to her jeweled ponytail seems to dwarf her unadorned and makeup free face. While this is not a physical dwarfing, it is more of a compositional dwarfing, with numerous elements of adornment concentrated in other parts of the portrait. Of course this could be reflective of garments and accessories Bianca actual wore while sitting for this portrait, and less about De Predis's compositional skills.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **While the only thing within the composition is Bianca, there are some underlying geometric structures within her garments and accessories. Triangles appear frequently in Bianca's garments, most prominently in the pearls wrapped around her ponytail, and again in the lacing in of her sleeve to the rest of the gown.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **The portrait appears to be balanced as Bianca is centered within the canvas and there are no other elements in the portrait besides Bianca to destabilize the composition. However, the fact that Bianca is depicted in profile means that the portrait, while seemingly balanced, is not symmetrical. The balance however is still found with the heavily jeweled ponytail in headdress to the right of the composition, but her necklace, girdle, and brocade gown featuring prominently on the left side of the portrait.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The unity of this portrait can be owed to the color balance. While there are examples of contrasting colors, her gown is a great example of the unity and**

### **interaction of separate elements. Her girdle and gown, while featuring different textures and colors, come across in a unified manner.**

- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **The artist is very clearly trying to demonstrate that Bianca is a legitimate daughter of the last Duke of Milan, and she is from an extremely wealthy family, in addition to recently having married the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian (National Gallery of Art, n.d.b). The fact that the composition does not require any background elements to help facilitate this purpose, is indicative of the level of wealth displayed in Bianca's appearance.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The choice of medium impacts the work in that it is consistent with the medium of portraiture during this period.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The artist does not really use rest to define the identity of the sitter as this is conveyed in other ways. However, as previously mentioned her position in profile could have been used to disguise her true facial appearance and to hint at her royal identity.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **The dress that Bianca is depicted in is especially consistent with her identity.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The garments that Bianca wears in this portrait are consistent with those worn during this period in Milan.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The jeweled ponytail style that Bianca wears in this portrait is possibly an iconic reference to her mother Bona of Savoy and her aunt Beatrice d'Este (who is credited for bringing the style to Milan) who were depicted in numerous other depictions with the same coazzone braid hair style. Her aunt was notably depicted in this style in the** *Sant' Ambrogio ad Nemus altarpiece* **in the Pala Sforzesca in 1494 which depicts Bianca's uncle's investiture as regent over the dukedom of Milan (following her father's assassination).**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **Bianca's clothing and accessories disguise and hide many elements of her body. While much of this is due to period stylistic conventions and ideas on modesty, the choice to depict Bianca in profile hides more of her body and face than her garments and hair do.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **The artist does not appear to have take any liberties with the visual representation of the sitter in terms of altering her physical appearance. Her body appears to be proportional for a realistic human depiction.**

- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This work was examined as it represents a pivotal depiction of Italian Renaissance portraiture, but also provides an intriguing data collection site for dress identity data on Bianca Maria Sforza prior to her second marriage.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **Upon seeing this image I am in awe at not only the amount of detail in which De Predis took in rendering Bianca's likeness, but in the amount of jewelry and adornment she is presented in which are also carefully rendered.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **I do not believe my personal reaction does not really indicate a shift in cultural beliefs.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I believe the only bias I have is reading numerous accounts of how Bianca was not considered beautiful by her contemporaries, yet I believe this painting depicts her as objectively beautiful (in profile at least).**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series? a. **This work appears to be a single work.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - **a.** *Portrait of a Young Woman* **(n.d.): This painting, frequently believed to be Beatrice d'Este depicts the woman in profile, in much the similar positioning as Bianca. This could be indicative of a composition style favored by De Predis than a preference in her own depiction (Wilcox, 1920).**
  - **b.** *Portrait of a Woman in Profile* **(1495-1499): This portrait is explained to be most likely be of a noblewoman (possibly Ludovico's illegitimate daughter Biana Giovanna) at the Milanese court of Duke Ludovico Sforza (Bianca's uncle)., as De Predis was a court painter there at the time. The less sophisticated dress of this woman really drives home the purposeful opulence in which Bianca is depicted (The National Gallery, n.d.).**
  - **c.** *Bianca Maria Sforza (1472-1510), Empress, profile portrait* **(1493-1495): This portrait showcases Bianca with the coazzone braid in a period after her marriage and move to modern day Germany. This could signify an adherence to her home dress traditions despite also acclimating to her husband's court attire. This 1493-1495 portrait depicts her in notably less jewelry and less ornamented garments, which could be indicative of this portrait showcasing Bianca in dress closer to that she would have worn everyday. This portrait, being dated to around her marriage could be indictive that while the 1493-95 portrait is Bianca's typical dress identity, this portrait represents her dress for celebrating/ promoting this momentous occasion.**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available),

consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?

- a. **As there is only one verified painting via signature created by De Predis (although numerous others have been formally credited to him due to the stylistic similarities). However, De Predis was notably a court painter in the dukedom of Milan and painted portraits of numerous members of the Sforza family. De De Predis was also known to be a student of Leonardo da Vinci (The National Gallery, n.d.; National Gallery of Art, n.d.b)**
- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - a. **It is unknown what method De De Predis used to create his portraits, however as the court painter from this period De De Predis would likely have painted the first few layers from Bianca being a live model.**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Coazzone braid**
  - b. **Laced in sleeves**
  - c. **Girdle belt**
  - d. **Ferrioniere**
  - e. **Sleeve slashing**
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?
  - a. **Please reference other De Predis portrait in this research.**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **This painting was likely created around the time of Bianca's marriage to Emperor Maximilian. According to the National Gallery of Art De Predis accompanied Bianca to Innsbruck for her marriage and created several portraits of Bianca and her new husband during this period (n.d.b). This work furthers period styles of profile portraits as well.**

## *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **The amount of jewelry, Sforza iconography, and general Italian influences on her dress, despite this portrait being credited to the period around her marriage to Emperor Maximilian. Furthermore, the carnation flower that is tucked into her girdle.**

  - a. **This work provokes the emotion of awe in the depiction/rendering of her garments, textiles, and accessories.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?

- a. **This work hints at the humanism and classicism traditions emerging in Renaissance art during this period, an emphasis on the accurate depiction of humans, emphasis on accurate rendering of textiles.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **This painting highlights the fact that fashion and dress were utilized as status indicators, especially in portraiture. The inclusion of subtle status elements , such as the Sforza motto, the three pomegranates, and even the carnation, further this idea that dress identity was a method for aristocratic women to communicate numerous elements of their personal identity.**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - **a. This portrait was likely created around the time of Bianca's 1493 marriage to Emperor Maximilian, the Holy Roman Emperor. As De Predis was a Milanese court painter it aligns with his skillset that he depicts Bianca in a similar manner to other Milanese/ Italian court portraits at the time (National Gallery of Art, n.d.b). As this portrait likely marks the transition of Bianca from a Sforza to a Habsburg her dress identity still marks numerous Sforza allegiances. The Sforza family motto is aptly included in the brooch attached to her ferronière, which states "Merito et tempore" which translates to "Merit and time". This could be indicative of Bianca's hopes for her new marriage, in addition to her remaining loyalty to the Sforza family and their values. Similarly, other elements of her dress indicate Bianca's possible hopes and dreams for her second marriage. The inclusion of the red carnation tucked into her girdle is an example of overt period symbolism, as during the Renaissance the inclusion of carnations in northern Italian Renaissance art referred to love and marriage (Meagher, 2007). Additionally, Bianca's brocade gown includes a series of motifs featuring three pomegranates on tree stumps. The pomegranates feature on the sleeve of her garment and across her chest (partially visible in profile) are likely to imply Bianca's desire to be very fertile and/ or live a very long life in her marriage (Fanelli, 1994). As this was Bianca's second marriage, her first having left her a widow by the age of 10, the now 21 year old Bianca, and period cultural norms, would expect her to provide her husband with children (Rill, 1968). This work is exceptionally relevant to Bianca's dress identity in portraiture throughout her marriage to Emperor Maximilian. The Strigel portraits from several years later depict Bianca having adopted a style of dress that further aligns with Habsburg court styles and those expected of the Empress. Furthermore, following the completion of this painting and her marriage political ties between Milan and the Holy Roman Empire became strained as Maximillian repeatedly attempts to control her uncle's territories (Rill, 1963). As such this painting in many ways can represent the last exertion of Bianca's Italian/ Milanese and Sforza identity.**

This in itself draws questions about the actuality of a physical black background existing at the time Bianca sat for the portrait.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **The perspective does not appear to be distorted or altered in any noticeable way.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **This painting appears to be smaller than live sized, closer to 1/3 human size. Furthermore, the size of the painting and the orientation in which Bianca sits creates the effect of the viewer turning to the side and seeing Bianca seated next to them.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **Due to the blacked-out background the only framing of the body occurring in this portrait is through the bounds of the campus. The choice of utilizing chiaroscuro to focus on Bianca is a straightforward use of the technique in portraiture. In essence, the way in which the body is situated in blackness achieves the portrait's purpose, to focus on Bianca's appearance.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The use of color in this composition draws a heightened attention to her gown. The color blocking of her gown speaks to a more dynamic composition and aids in unifying the composition. The gold color in her headpiece aids in guiding the eye back down to the similar color of her sleeve and the other bright blue-green color of her gown bodice.**

## *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **The artist emphasized Bianca's dress and accessories over her own physical appearance.**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **The artist uses color and detail most strongly to convey this emphasis. See Observation question #40.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?

- a. **The underlying circular shape of pearls appears in numerous places in the composition. Furthermore, to ad to the humanistic nature of the composition style there are only two straight lines in the composition: Bianca's ferronière and the black hair ties on her coazzone braid.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **Balance is mostly achieved through use and distribution of color in this composition. The darker colors are more concentrated at the top half of the composition while the rest of the composition, with her pale visible upper chest and brightly colored green-blue bodice, white camicia, and gold sleeve. Despite the composition depicting Bianca in profile the ornateness of her coazzone braid provides some balance in terms of content to the right side of the composition (Bianca's back).**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The composition appears fairly unified. As previously mentioned the color choice aids in the overall unity and balance of the portrait. Furthermore, the interaction of each element of the portrait is contained within Bianca (her face, her dress, etc). The overlapping of each portion of her body ad dress aid in this integrated appearance. For example, a strand of Bianca's hair falls and almost touches the gold necklace on her chest, and the gold necklace lays and overlaps on top her gown neckline.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **The artist is possibly trying to express Bianca's growing and adapting identity as she abandoned her Italian stylistic upbringing, and adopting her own everyday style within the Habsburg court.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The choice of medium impacts the work in that it is consistent with the medium of portraiture during this period.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The artist does not really use rest to define the identity of the sitter as this is conveyed in other ways. However, as previously mentioned her position in profile could have been used to disguise her true facial appearance and to hint at her royal identity.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation? a. **The dress that Bianca is depicted in is consistent with her identity.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The garments that Bianca wears in this portrait are consistent with those worn during this period in Milan.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The ponytail style that Bianca wears in this portrait is possibly an iconic reference to her mother Bona of Savoy and her aunt Beatrice d'Este (who is credited for bringing the style to Milan) who were depicted in numerous**

**other depictions with the same coazzone braid hair style. Her aunt was notably depicted in this style in the** *Sant' Ambrogio ad Nemus altarpiece* **in the Pala Sforzesca in 1494 which depicts Bianca's uncle's investiture as regent over the dukedom of Milan (following her father's assassination).** 

- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **Bianca's clothing and accessories disguise and hide many elements of her body. While much of this is due to period stylistic conventions and ideas on modesty, the choice to depict Bianca in profile hides more of her body and face than her garments and hair do.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **The artist does not appear to have take any liberties with the visual representation of the sitter in terms of altering her physical appearance. Her body appears to be proportional for a realistic human depiction.**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This artwork was examined as it provides insight into Bianca's dress identity in the early years of her marriage to Maximilian. This then aids in giving data about Bianca's dress identity during various periods of her life.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **This portrait does not promote as strong of an emotive reaction compared to De Predis's earlier portrait of Bianca. However, this painting's use of color does aid in promoting a happy reaction with the bright colors of her dress bodice and sleeve.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My personal reaction is not connected to cultural beliefs.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I believe the only bias I have is reading numerous accounts of how Bianca was not considered beautiful by her contemporaries, yet I believe this painting depicts her as objectively beautiful (in profile at least).**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **This artwork is a single portrait.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - **a.** *Portrait of a Young Woman* **(n.d.): This painting, frequently believed to be Beatrice d'Este depicts the woman in profile, in much the similar positioning as Bianca. This could be indicative of a composition style favored by De Predis than a preference in her own depiction (Wilcox, 1920).**
  - **b.** *Portrait of a Woman in Profile* **(1495-1499): This portrait is explained to be most likely be of a noblewoman (possibly Ludovico's illegitimate daughter Biana Giovanna) at the Milanese court of Duke Ludovico Sforza (Bianca's uncle)., as De Predis was a court painter there at the time. The less**

**sophisticated dress of this woman really drives home the purposeful opulence in which Bianca is depicted (The National Gallery, n.d.).** 

- **c.** *Bianca Maria Sforza* **(1493): This portrait showcases Bianca wearing the same coazzone braid, however her snood/headpiece is far more ornate than the one depicted in this painting. This could signify an adherence to her home dress traditions despite also acclimating to her husband's court attire. This portrait depicts her in notably less jewelry and less ornamented garments, which could be indicative of this portrait showcasing Bianca in dress closer to that she would have worn everyday. While the 1493 painting depicts the Sforza family motto, this painting notably does not have any Sforza symbolism, possibly indicating a severing of ties with her family in Milan in favor of her husband.**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?
  - a. **See Predis 1493 analysis.**
- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - a. **See Predis 1493 analysis.**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Coazzone braid**
  - b. **Laced in sleeves**
  - c. **Ferrioniere**
  - d. **Sleeve slashing**
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?
  - a. **See Predis 1493 analysis.**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **See Predis 1493 analysis. Additionally, as de Predis only remained at the Habsburg court with Bianca for a few years into her marriage, this portrait could speak to her evolving dress identity as she adapts to a style that is less distinctly Italian, yet still wears key Milanese and Italian accessories.**

# *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **The gold necklace pendant still sticks out to me as I was unable to identify the symbolism of the silver crosses on the pendant. Additionally, I found the color blocking of her gown and sleeve. From my own research this style would not have been common in Italian Renaissance dress of the period.**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?

- a. **This work aids in answering my preestablished research question and endeavor to identify the evolution of Bianca Maria Sforza's dress identity in numerous periods of her life.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **This artwork aligns with period portraiture conventions in Italy and by de Predis. Her profile depiction, her dress, and even the depiction of her hair aligns with period sentiments.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **The fashion and dress in this portrait highlights the Italian Renaissance emphasis on construction details over brocade or complex textiles.**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - a. **At the time of the painting of this portrait, Bianca was likely within two years of her marriage to Maximillian. However, Bianca and Masimillian did not live together until 1494, which could indicate why this portrait depicts her still in a majority Italian and Milanese style of dress. Considering that Bianca's dowry was utilized to fund her husband's military exploits in the first two years of their marriage and the fact that the couple lived apart, one can conclude that in the eyes of Maximillian, Bianca served her purpose (providing an enormous influx in wealth to him) and was allowed to live and dress as she pleased (Rill, 1968). Furthermore, the lack of contact with her husband at this point and her pending investiture as Empress, could explain the lack of Habsburg symbolism in her dress identity, as legally she was part of the Habsburg family, however she lived apart from her husband and likely had not been forced to assimilate some aspects of her life to fit with her husband's culture and court.**

- 12. How many persons are included in the artwork?
  - a. **There is one person in this work.**
- 13. Are the figures in the artwork known persons? Is the work intended as a portrait? Can they be identified by name? If so, this knowledge of their identity inform your analysis?
  - a. **The person in this portrait is Bianca Maria Sforza, and her identifiable nature within this portrait was on of the impetus for analyzing it.**

  - a. **A specific place or setting is not identifiable other than the green tapestry and assumingly German countryside in the background.**
- 18. What elements of the setting or background are notable?
  - a. **The green tapestry in the background is of note as it is highly ornate brocade juxtaposed with an elaborate countryside mountain-scape next to it.**
- 19. Does the setting convey status, privilege, or other meaning?
  - a. **The green tapestry conveys wealth and a level of privilege to be able to afford such a textile, let lone have it placed in a setting that is potentially outside. Furthermore, to have some form of balcony/ window with a view such as the one in this portrait also hints at a specific level of privilege.**
- 20. Are the people in the artwork clothed? If not, are the naked bodies ornamented or fashioned in some way?
  - a. **Bianca is clothed.**
- 21. How are the people oriented (front facing, three-quarter view, profile, or back facing)? Consider what this orientation signifies.

- 23. Consider the posture of the sitter(s). Are they seated, standing, or reclining? Are parts of the body not visible in the image? Is their posture rigid or relaxed? Is posture indicative of state of mind and/or training of the body?
  - a. **Bianca is positioned with a straight back, head up, and arms crossed over her stomach/ womb. This posture is indicative of high class breeding/ upbringing, that which would be expected of the daughter of a wealthy and influential duke and the wife of an emperor.**
- 24. Are other objects or animals included in the image to depict activities, interest, or status,…? How does the sitter engage with these objects?
  - a. **Bianca interacts with her gloves. One hand remains gloved, while the other is worn on her hand.**
- 25. Describe the main elements of clothing for each person in the image in detail, noting the garment category and how it is worn. Also note whether any outdoor clothing.
  - a. **Bianca wears a gown with a camicia underneath it with layered sleeves (one fitted and one extremely flowing). There is elaborate embroidery and brocade on the bodice which stops slightly below the empire line.**
- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **The exact textile can not be definitively identified, however her gown features multi-colored brocade and embroidery. Over her bust is a type of tapestry narrative with birds flying over five people. The gown itself is red with gold accents, the gold accents take the shape of flames up the shorter sleeves of the outer gown.**

- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?
  - a. **See question #26**
- 28. Is any element of dress exaggerated?
  - a. **The sleeves of her camicia coming out of her gown are exceptionally dramatic in size and would not realistically fit in the narrower sleeves of the upper gown.**
- 29. Describe the accessories of each person…Note how they are worn, carried, or placed in the image.
  - **a. She appears to be wearing pink fitted gloves with top stitching at the thumb seam. She has three rings on her ungloved hand (same as the other Strigel portrait). Bianca is wearing five necklaces: two large circular chain linked necklaces, two braided necklaces (one with a knot on her collarbone), and one large circular chain linked necklace styled as a choker. Her headdress appears to be made of braid with jewels along the front.**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - **a. The headdress she wears seems to be almost crown-like. There are two peacocks across her gown collar that is a signifier of royalty ( ).**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **The elaborate dress Bianca is wearing and the addition of her impractical sleeves hint at her high socio-economic class and overall royal status.**
- 32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - a. **Bianca's hair has bangs framing her face, and then pulled back and up into her headdress. Bianca does not appear to be wearing any makeup.**
- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **The portrait appears to be realistic.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **The painting appears to be completed in all parts, with every aspect clear.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **See responses in Strigel 1505-10 (KM Vienna).**
- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **There are formal distinctions between the foreground (Bianca), the midground (the tapestry), and the background (the landscape outside the window). However, the interactions between these three spaces are tentative at best. Bianca's shadow falls on the tapestry which can be called a very passive interaction between the two spaces, yet there is no such interaction between the foreground and midground and the background which sits as its own entity. It is possible that the window in which we see the background through may not have existed in real life.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **It does not appear that the perspective has been distorted.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?

- a. **The portrait is similar in size to a half body portrait, creating a close to life sized effect, and no doubt furthering the feeling of regal elegance and wealth felt when viewing this painting.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **The artist utilized line to directly shape the framing of the body. In an arguably obvious technique, the artist positions the tapestry behind Bianca to create an off-center framing of her body, and creating a balanced composition. The tapestry edge that hangs from the top of the painting aids in further framing the portrait as it creates a border/frame within the composition that draws the eyes back down to Bianca.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The abundance of red in the composition allows the viewer's eyes to focus on Bianca. The red not within the garments Bianca is wearing (the red velvet she sits on and the red trim of the tapestry) create a balance of color within the composition and subtly draw the eyes back to the more prominent and rich red hues Bianca is wearing. Furthermore, the white/cream color of her camicia sleeves brings the eye completely on Bianca's body. The bodice piece with the narrative scene in it brings in white and green to the gown (the only location on the gown where these colors are present) drawing the viewer's eye to these colors and this scene.**

## *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **The artist emphasized the elaborateness and the details within Bianca's gown. This is used as a means to convey her status and position within society.**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **The artist emphasized this through color, line, and the Humanist details included in the textiles that make up her garments.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **The composition focuses on rectangular compositions behind Bianca (possible as a method to better frame her within the composition or not distract from her figure in the composition), while her physical seated form creates a triangular structure, with her head serving as the point and the lower half of her body representing the base. This non-right angular element drastically stands out against the rectangular midground and background compositional components.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **The artist has created a slightly destabilized composition. The lack of symmetry allows for a more targeted emphasis on Bianca. The fact that she is positioned slightly off-centered to the right while her body is ¾ facing the left**

**side of the portrait allows the eyes to sweep down the body at an angle from the upper right hand of the portrait to the lower left side.** 

- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **This painting lacks some elements of unity. The quality of the background and midground elements of the composition create a disjointed emphasis. While the key figure of the portrait is put to the forefront the other elements are so one-dimensional it disrupts the integration of all the elements of the painting.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **I believe the artist is trying to emphasize the grandeur and wealth of Bianca and her husband as emperor and empress. The richness of the fabric, garments, and accessories Bianca is depicted wearing easily conveys this goal.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The choice of medium does not impact the work, but rather adheres to period artistic/ portrait conventions.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The formal pose in which Bianca is depicted (head up, arms/ hands purposefully crossed) presents a very regal persona. This is especially true when one considers the precariously positioned headdress she wears, as it would require lots of practice and breeding to sit straight with such an accessory.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **The dress of Bianca is highly consistent with her position as the daughter of a high powered duke and wife to the Holy Roman Emperor, and as such the Holy Roman Empress.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The gown that Bianca is wearing straddles the line between consistent and inconsistent elements. The extremely long and voluminous nature of the camicia sleeves and the waistline closer to an empire line are both more consistent with styles seen in the Late Middle ages or early Italian Renaissance (circa early-mid 15th century).**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **One can infer that the inclusion of peacocks and the flame-like motifs are meant to signify strong royal/ aristocratic rule or lineage. The styles she are wearing align with those worn in Northern Europe during the period, and a nod to the latent fashion advances present in Northern Europe at a time that marked the High Renaissance in Italy and arguably the beginning of the Northern Renaissance.**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - i. **The sleeve styles completely disguise the middle section of Bianca's arms, while dwarfing her hands. This might be a possible attempt at**

**making her hands appear more dainty and align with Northern Renaissance beauty ideals in respect to hands (Welch, 2011). Notably in this depiction of Bianca the size of her sleeves, the waistline cut, and the position of her arms all conceal or aim to take attention away from her stomach/womb, a possible indicator of her motherless status a mere one to five years before her death.** 

- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **The body does not appear to be distorted or misrepresented in any noticeable way. However, her face does appear to be very young for an individual that was between the ages of 33 and 38 in this depiction. She instead appears to look like a teenager or in her early 20s, and definitely not the sickly ugly woman that was described at the time of her marriage to Emperor Maximillian. This altered depiction could be a choice of vanity, an attempt to depict Bianca as appearing closer to her portraits from her youth (those commissioned prior to her marriage to Emperor Maximillian).**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This artwork was examined because it showcases Bianca in distinctly Northern European style of dress and provides interesting data in an effort to answer my research question.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **Bianca's headdress kind of freaks me out as it reminds me of a bird or bug's nest. The headdress is also very simple compared to the rest of her dress.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My personal reaction to Bianca's headdress indicates a dramatic shift in what is considered/ had been considered "fashionable" in fashion history and culture.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I am familiar with Bianca's other portraits by Predis, which might skew my opinon on her appearance. This is especially important to note as the Predis portraits were painted almost two decades prior to this portrait.**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **This painting appears to be a single work (although there is a very similar painting from Strigel's workshop).**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - a. **Strigel's workshop produced another Strigel work that was extrememly similar from the same year. That portrait has more obvert iconography indicative of Bianca's status and position. Furthermore, that portrait had more of an emphasis on the rest of her body (bust, stomach/ womb, arms, etc), possibly an earlier attempt at this portrait. The differences between these two portraits hint at a shifting idea of how the sitter wanted or needed**

## **to be portrayed. This portrait specifically hints more to the viewer's own possible preferences as she hinds her true age, health, and any indication or relation to her lack of children.**

20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?

## a. **See Strigel 1505-10 (KM Vienna) Analysis**

21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?

# a. **It is not known what methods the artist used to conceive this work.**

- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Gloves**
  - b. **German Dress**
  - c. **Peacock motif**
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?

# a. **See other images in data of Bianca Maria Sforza**

- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **The way Bianca's headdress is perched on her head reflects period sentiments of disguising one's hairline in an effort to appear more beautiful. The addition of gloves. The 16th century marked a period in which aristocratic and royal women took to being depicted with gloves. Leather gloves specifically, such as the assumed dyed pink ones in this portrait, were viewed as a status symbol as they were very expensive. Furthermore, an aristocratic woman wearing gloves hinted at a life of leisure as she had no reason to use her bare hands (Welch, 2009).**

## *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **The peacock motifs and the embroidered narrative across her bust. The digital image I have used for my research is not a high enough resolution to identify any serious indicators of what (likely a biblical scene) is depicted. Additionally, the atypical period dress Bianca is depicted in also proves perplexing.**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **After my analysis this painting makes me feel sad. This painting represents possibly the original way in which Bianca wanted to be depicted and includes a possibly unrealistic depiction of her actual dress identity. For all intents and purposes, this portrait is of a woman living in the past.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?

- a. **This work showcases the artist's dedication to the sitter's wishes and to the growing popularity of the humanist Italian style of portraiture, with an emphasis on details in dress (i.e. the folds and gathers of the sleeves).**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **As the dress in this portrait is atypical of the period it does not say much other than possibly the nostalgia Bianca had for earlier fashion trends in her last years, or the latent arrival of new styles to the Habsburg court.**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - a. **Bianca Maria Sforza was born in April 1472 to the Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza and Bona of Savoy. Following her father's 1476 assassination, the Milanese dukedom fell to her uncle Ludovico, who took on arranging Bianca's future marriages. In 1493, after her first husband had died in 1482, Bianca Maria Sforza married the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian of the Habsburgs. While Bianca brought with her an exceptionally large dowry and ties to the Milanese dukedom, their marriage was not a "successful" one.**
  - b. **By the time of this portrait was painted it was between one and five years before Bianca's premature death (suspected to have been caused by consumption), and Bianca was still, and would remain childless (Rill, 1968). This knowledge appears to affirm certain rationale behind the specific dress identity Bianca aimed to create. In this portrait she conceals a number of her feminine body parts in an effort to distance herself from the expectation of providing an heir/ child. As Bianca was one to five years from her death at the time of this portrait, she seems to be conveying a dress identity that is just for her. Her bust is disguised with an unknown narrative scene, her stomach/womb is hidden under yards of fabric from her sleeves, and yet her dainty hands are revealed with their bright pink gloves to remind the viewer of her position as an aristocratic lady twice over (an Empress and daughter to a duke). This is further solidified by the inclusion of numerous elements of jewelry such as the chained choker that includes the pure and regal pearls.**

- 16. Is the setting indoors or outdoors?
  - a. **The setting appears to be indoors.**
- 17. Does the artwork depict a specific place or setting?

- a. **It is assumed that this is in the palace of her husband Emperor Maximillian I.**
- 18. What elements of the setting or background are notable?
  - a. **Bianca sits directly in front of a green tapestry covered in floral and natural motifs, along with a crown.**
- 19. Does the setting convey status, privilege, or other meaning?
  - a. **The setting conveys a level of wealth and privilege as Bianca is sitting around a tapestry with elaborate detailing that hints at her status. Furthermore, she is sitting on some form of red velvet (perhaps a blanket or bench, or throne). There appears to also be a window on the left side of the portrait that looks out over the countryside with buildings and possibly a church.**
- 20. Are the people in the artwork clothed? If not, are the naked bodies ornamented or fashioned in some way?
  - a. **Bianca is clothed in the portrait.**
- 21. How are the people oriented (front facing, three-quarter view, profile, or back facing)? Consider what this orientation signifies.
  - a. **Bianca is positioned in a slight ¾, slight front facing orientation.**
- 22. What is the gender of each person in the image? Has the artist emphasized gender or obscured it?
  - a. **Bianca is a woman. This is emphasized through her dress, and subtle gestures (such as her hand positioned over her stomach, a nod towards her fertility.**
- 23. Consider the posture of the sitter(s). Are they seated, standing, or reclining? Are parts of the body not visible in the image? Is their posture rigid or relaxed? Is posture indicative of state of mind and/or training of the body?
  - a. **Bianca is seated with her back in a straight upright posture. Her lack of slouch and the way in which her head is slightly lifted and her hands are delicately crossed is indicative of her aristocratic upbringing and new status as an empress.**
- 24. Are other objects or animals included in the image to depict activities, interest, or status,…? How does the sitter engage with these objects?
  - a. **Bianca does not have any other objects or animals depicted with her in the painting.**
- 25. Describe the main elements of clothing for each person in the image in detail, noting the garment category and how it is worn. Also note whether any outdoor clothing.
  - a. **Bianca wears a 16th century gown akin with Italian styles which include large gaps in the sleeve in which you can see the camicia underneath it. She also has a turban-like headpiece that was common in Italy during the period (Tortora & , ).**
- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **The ground fabric of her gown appears to be some form of pile weave (possibly velvet as it was common during this period and would create the same shine on the surface as seen in this portrait or an ornate boucle). It is also likely that the camicia she wears beneath her gown is made of some silk or linen weave. Her gown is made of a burnt gold/ bronze like color with**

**black embroidery. There are numerous tied bows throughout the ensemble, with embroidery and various elements that appear to look like embroidered leaves (on the bodice and her turban-like cap).**

- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?
  - a. **The clothing is heavily embellished. There are a number of tied ribbons of various sizes (in red and gold), star shaped slashings on the sleeves, letters embroidered on the neckline (and M and B likely for Maximilian and Bianca).There is embroidery on her gown including what appears to be little gold fabric leaves on the front of her bodice. Similarly, there are golden thread bows embroidered into her turban.**
- 28. Is any element of dress exaggerated?
  - a. **The amount of fabric pouring out her tied sleeves at the elbow is not realistic as it is too much fabric to have been practical or within the style of the period.**
- 29. Describe the accessories of each person…Note how they are worn, carried, or placed in the image.
  - a. **Bianca wears one glove and holds the other in her hand (mustard colored). She is also depicted in an abundance of jewelry, so much so one can conclude this was possibly an official court portrait of her as Empress of the Holy Roman Empire, and not a depiction of her in everyday dress. She wears 7 necklaces: two of double strands of pearls and braided gold chain; 3 of decorated gold chains and one plain black string likely attached to a crucifix (theses four necklaces are tucked into her bodice), and one choker made of gold flowers with a large rectangular ruby (?) with a large pearl and emerald attached to it. She also is wearing 3 rings on her ungloved hand, and gold brooch with a large pearl attached is dangling from her turban-like headdress.**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **There is an embroidered crown on the neckline of her gown with her and her husband's initials beneath it. Furthermore, the size and amount of her jewelry is heavily indicative of her status as an empress.**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **Her garments and accessories serve as a strong indicator of her identity and social status.**
- 32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - a. **Bianca has her hair slightly draped around her face and pulled back into a gold braided snood, which is underneath the elaborate turban-like headdress. Bianca appears to be wearing a light colored lipstick and lots of blush on her cheeks.**
- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **This image is fairly realistic.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **The background seen out of the window on the left side of the painting is slightly indistinguishable with some of the buildings appearing unfinished as the colors/paint of the green landscape bleeds through.**

- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **This artwork represents a transition from the northern Renaissance art convention of the International Style to a more mannerist/ humanist approach influenced by the success of Italian artists of the period. The one dimensionality of the background elements (the tapestry and the simplistic outdoor scene through the window) and Bianca's flat shadowless face are reminiscent of Northern Renaissance styles of painting leftover from the mid/early 15th century. However, the depiction of Bianca's clothes and accessories draw direct influence from Italian conventions (National Gallery of Art, n.d.). Strigel's work is also noted to have some influences from the Ulm school which centered around southern German artists of the period (Thyssen-Bornemisza Museo, n.d.).**
- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **The sense of space in the painting is lacking, as past Bianca herself the image appears exceptionally one-dimensional. Arguably there are formal distinctions between the foreground (Bianca), the midground (the tapestry), and the background (the landscape outside the window). However, the interactions between these three spaces are tentative at best. Bianca's shadow falls on the tapestry which can be called a very passive interaction between he two spaces, yet there is no such interaction between the foreground and midground and the background which sits as its own entity. It is possible that the window in which we see the background through may not have existed in real life, which could explain its lack of detail and its appearance as almost a mandatory element of the composition.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **Perspective has slightly been altered in the sense that the artist is not utilizing a consistent light source. For example, the back of Bianca's headdress should be in complete shadow, yet part of it is highlighted, the same can be found with elements of her face, gown, and jewelry.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **The portrait is similar in size to a half body portrait, creating a close to life sized effect, and no doubt furthering the feeling of regal elegance and wealth felt when viewing this painting.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **The artist utilized line to directly shape the framing of the body. In an arguably obvious technique, the artist positions the tapestry behind Bianca to create an off-center framing of her body, and creating a balanced composition. The tapestry edge that hangs from the top of the painting aids in further framing the portrait as it creates a border/frame within the composition that draws the eyes back down to Bianca.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?

a. **The abundance of red in the composition allows the viewer's eyes to focus on Bianca. The red not within the garments Bianca is wearing (the red velvet she sits on and the red trim of the tapestry) create a balance of color within the composition and subtly draw the eyes back to the more prominent and rich red hues Bianca is wearing.** 

### *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **The artist emphasized the elaborateness of the dress of Bianca. This was undoubtly intentional as her dress and dress identity are what communicate her status as the wife of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Holy Roman Empress.**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **The artist emphasized this utilizing both color (see observation question #40) and line. The long crossed arms of Bianca draw the eyes further into the bodice and sleeve elements depicted on her gown. The abundance of tied ribbons paired with the straight and gathered lines of the sleeves and furthermore the plain black lines that make up the embroidery on her gown all combine together to draw focus on this pivotal dress identifier.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **The composition focuses on rectangular compositions behind Bianca (possible as a method to better frame her within the composition or not distract from her figure in the composition), while her physical seated form creates a triangular structure, with her head serving as the point and the lower half of her body representing the base. This non-right angular element drastically stands out against the rectangular midground and background compositional components.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **The artist has created a slightly destabilized composition. The lack of symmetry allows for a more targeted emphasis on Bianca. The fact that she is positioned slightly off-centered to the right while her body is ¾ facing the left side of the portrait allows the eyes to sweep down the body at an angle from the upper right hand of the portrait to the lower left side.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **This painting lacks some elements of unity. The quality of the background and midground elements of the composition create a disjointed emphasis. While the key figure of the portrait is put to the forefront the other elements are so one-dimensional it disrupts the integration of all the elements of the painting.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **I believe the artist is trying to emphasize the grandeur and wealth of Bianca and her husband as emperor and empress. The richness of the fabric, garments, and accessories Bianca is depicted wearing easily conveys this goal.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?

- a. **The choice of medium does not impact the work, but rather adheres to period artistic/ portrait conventions.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The formal pose in which Bianca is depicted (head up, arms/ hands purposefully crossed) presents a very regal persona. This is especially true when one considers the precariously positioned headdress she wears, as it would require lots of practice and breeding to sit straight with such an accessory.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **The dress of Bianca is highly consistent with her position as the daughter of a high powered duke and wife to the Holy Roman Emperor, and as such the Holy Roman Empress.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The garments Bianca wears are consistent with the period, and draw influences from her Lombardy home and the German royal court of the Holy Roman Empire.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **As previously mentioned, the most notable garment reference is the embroidery on the collar of her gown that includes a crown and her and her husband's initials. The leather gloves worn by Bianca is a possible indicator of her high status within court (Welch, 2009).**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The clothing and accessories manage to conceal the body by contemporary standards, but by period standards reveals and showcases quiet a lot. The large puffs of camicia visible and the large headdress make her appear to take up more space.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **It does not appear that the artist has taken any major appearance distortions or alterations.**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This artwork was examined as a means to provide more information to answer my research question. Furthermore, this provides an image of Bianca Maria Sforza in a mix of Italian and German dress.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **My initial reaction to this painting is slightly overwhelmed. The amount of fabric and jewelry Bianca is wearing and the volume of her sleeves is almost gaudy.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?

- a. **My opinion on the amount of jewelry and embellishment Bianca is wearing reflects how contemporary dress standards believe dress like this would be considered gaudy and low class, while this type of display of wealth.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **The bias that should be acknowledged is the fact that I am far more knowledgeable about Italian-Spanish styles of this period instead of Italian-German styles of the period.**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **This is a single work although there is another image from Strigel's workshop that is similar.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - a. **See question #18**
    - i. **Strigel 1505-1510: While the dress in this portrait is similar to this one, it is less gaudy as the other one.**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?
  - a. **Strigel is not a well researched artist, and his work found most of its fame 20th and 21st centuries. As such there are no exhibitions, biographies, or documents relating to Strigel. However, there was the 1925 compilation of some of Strigel's sketches in** *Belvedere* **(Vol 8, pp 29-44) by K.T. Parker and W. Hugelshofer (Shestack, 1966). Strigel was noted to having been influenced by a number of other more high profile south German artists of the period including Dürer and Hans Strigel (Thyssen-Bornemisza Museo, n.d.)**
- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - a. **It is not known what methods the artist used to conceive this work.**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Gloves**
  - b. **Slashing**
  - c. **German Dress**
  - d. **Italian-German Dress**
  - e. **Turban headdress**
  - f. **Snood**
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?
  - a. **Yes, see other art assembled of this person in the course of this research.**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **This painting marks a period at the start of the 16th century in which many cultural influences from Italy are being spread to Northern Europe. The**

## **wearing of the turban-like headdress the commonplace nature of trade and cross-cultural influences during this period along with the highly complex textiles she is wearing.**

### *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **The amount of overt symbols of rank and wealth. I found this very interesting as it contrasts to other portraits of different women from the same period. The volume of the garments and accessories she wears are defiantly over sized in a blatant manner.**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This work makes you curious as to why Bianca's identity conveyed through dress is so "loud".**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **The work says that in the Northern Renaissance artistic tradition the emphasis is on the subject of the painting, and all artistic effort is place on that. Thus the background elements are depicted as an afterthought.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **The depiction of fashion in this work shows that it had emnorumous meaning in European culture tied to numerous aspects about identity (class, gender, wealth, motherhood, etc).**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - a. **Bianca Maria Sforza was born in April 1472 to the Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza and Bona of Savoy. Following her father's 1476 assassination, the Milanese dukedom fell to her uncle Ludovico, who took on arranging Bianca's future marriages. In 1493, after her first husband had died in 1482, Bianca Maria Sforza married the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian of the Habsburgs. While Bianca brought with her an exceptionally large dowry and ties to the Milanese dukedom, their marriage was not a "successful" one. By the time of this portrait was painted it was between one and five years before Bianca's premature death (suspected to have been caused by consumption), and Bianca was still, and would remain childless (Rill, 1968). This knowledge appears to affirm certain rationale behind the specific dress identity Bianca aimed to create. It would be advantageous for the childless empress to depict herself in an abundance of jewels and the finest gowns, as a reminder to those at court of her position. Despite her and her husband's distant relationship Bianca still aimed to convey a untied identity to him, as evidenced in his initial appearing on her collar below a crown. It is also possible that Bianca found solace in jewels, gowns, and the finer things in life**

**to distract from her distant marriage and feuding family (at the time her uncle, now duke of Milan and her husband were not on good terms). Having in previous years utilized her position to provide aid to Sforza troops against the French, Bianca was notably not a fan of her uncle Ludovico (Rill, 1968). The fact that she is depicted with her hand placed near her stomach could also be indicative of the hope she still had to produce an heir, or a child at all. Sadly, she died in December 1510 childless.**

- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **The ferronière was a type of head accessory typically seen on aristocratic women, therefore it can be perceived as a signifier of rank in addition to other forms of dress depicted in this painting.**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **The ermine itself is representative of Cecilia's lover the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, who two years prior to the painting of this portrait had received the Order of Ermine from the King of Naples. Sforza was subsequently known as Ermellino Bianco (white ermine) (Dec & Wałek, n.d.). The presences of the ermine links Cecilia directly to the duke.**
- 32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - **a. Cecilia is depicted wearing two ferronière, and the manner in which her hair is styled lends to her wearing a coazzone braid. Her hair is parted down the middle, she has her hair in side pieces that fall along her face, and there appears to be some form of ponytail/braid visible down her neck. This hair style would be very consistent with dress at the Milanese court during this period (Welch, 2009).**
- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **This image appears to be realistic, with the exception of the allegorical ermine, which was likely an artistic addition.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **The background is all black, and therefore indistinguishable. Aside from the background the painting appears complete, with all elements distinguishable.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **This artwork does fit within Northern Italian Renaissance portraiture conventions. This period in art history showcased an affinity towards classicism (which involved the use of allegories and metaphors) and humanism (realistic depictions of life, objects, and people). Both of these philosophies are present in Da Vinci's work.**
- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **There is no real sense of background as it is plain black. However, the ¾ pose in which Cecilia is depicted allows for the mantle covered shoulder to puncture the foreground with her hands holding the white ermine. Then the mid-ground is occupied by Cecilia's shadowed half of her body. The fore and**

## **mid ground are linked in that they are present and occupied by the same object/person and are distinguished through Da Vinci's use of light source.**

- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **Perspective does not appear to be distorted or altered.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **The work is close to half scale with the height of the portrait below 2ft. As Cecilia was not a high ranking member of the Ducal family (by blood at least), her smaller scaled portrait creates a more intimate and personable impression. The type of impression that would not be suitable for a royal portrait.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **Cecilia's body fills up a majority of the canvas and with the blacked out background she appears to exist outside of a particular setting or space. The background creates the illusion of the absence of space allowing the viewer to focus on Cecilia and the ermine. The lines of the armhole on her mantle provide a direct gesture towards the ermine. Similarly, her square neckline and her black bead necklace act as linear connections between Cecilia's face and the lower part of her body.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **Da Vinci's use of color aids in drawing attention to Cecilia and the ermine. The all black background enhances he prominence of the brighter hues on her gown and mantle (white, orange, blue, gold). The white ermine specifically stands out as while it is not a pure white (it is likely it originally was a starker white, but has faded over time) attention is immediately drawn to the create as it is the lightest color in the composition. The inclusion of a light colored mantle on her shoulder closest to the ermine aids in drawing the eyes between Cecilia's face and the ermine. As the colors of her garments change as the eyes move along the body aids in maintaining balance in the composition.**

## *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **Da Vinci visually emphasized the ermine and Cecilia within the portrait. A focus that draws allegorical connections to the Duke of Milan.**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **Da Vinci emphasized this in his use of color and subtly through his use of line within Cecilia's garments and accessories.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **The circular halo shape is repeated several times within the composition (the two ferronière and her black bead necklace).**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **The use of color provides balance to aspects of the portrait. The presence of black throughout Cecilia's dress represents a color based callback to the all**

**black background, and aids in adding dimension to the composition. The different hues of white (the highlights of her skin, the ermine, and the camicia) all add dimensional balance. However, the overall composition is unbalanced with the painting appearing to be content heavy on the left side due to the angle in which Cecilia is positioned paired with the directional gaze of Cecilia and the ermine.**

- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The composition does seem unified in the fore and mid-grounds. However, the background of black exists as its own plane completely separated from the other two more integrated spaces.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **I think Da Vinci aimed to express the beauty and status of Cecilia in relation to the Duke. Her status is conveyed through her complex and expensive dress and her close association with the ermine (a metaphor for the duke).**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The choice of medium is consistent with period conventions of portraiture.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **Cecilia's calm and at ease pose and demeanor hint at her carefree lifestyle. She is depicted looking away from the viewer as if without a care in the world while holding her beloved ermine (the duke) close to her heart.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **Cecilia's dress is a clear indication of her gender and class/status/occupation as an aristocratic woman. The wearing of a ferronniere specifically, speaks to all of these identities as they were prominently worn by aristocratice women at the Milanese court during this period.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The garments worn by Cecilia in this painting are consistent with the period and region.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The blue mantle could have symbolism towards the Virgin Mary as she is frequently depicted in a blue mantle in Italian Renaissance art. The ferronniere was a especially popular style in Northern Italy during this period and features prominently in paintings created of Milanese women.**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The fitted sleeves and slashing both reveal and conceal the body in a manner that was considered very fashionable during this period. However, the mantle on her right shoulder hides the entire side of her body. As the painting is only a half body portrait and the ermine in her arms covers most of her body that is not already visible, one can argue that the overall composition aims to conceal her bodice/ stomach. This could possibly be a**

**result of the fact that she was pregnant with her Ludovico's child at the time and was unmarried.**

- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **The artist does not appear to have taken in liberties in the portrayal of Cecilia.**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This work was selected for analysis on the basis of its definitive subject and the number of symbolic (both overt and subvert) dress identity and identity markers.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **I find Da Vinci's use of color on Cecilia's garments to be very appealing in contrast to the dark background. I also feel at ease when looking at the expression on Cecilia's face.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My personal reaction has no connection to cultural beliefs.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I do not have any personal connection to this work.**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **This work is a single work.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - a. *La Belle Ferronnière***, 1490-1499, Louvre: This painting features a similarly dressed woman. She is likely also from the Milanese court based on her coazzone braid and ferronniere. Similar to the portrait under analysis the subject is placed in front of a plain black background. This pattern could be an indicator that for his portraiture work Da Vinci aimed to focus on composition exclusively on his subject without creating scenic background landscapes like other artists of the period.**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?
  - a. **Vasari ( ) speaks of Da Vinci's talent and works as if describing a poetic master of all arts. Da Vinici is also noted for his excellent use of colors and the technique of chiaroscuro, which is evidenced in this painting through the use of the all black background to further highlight Cecilia and the ermine. Having been brought to Milan in 1482 by Ludovico, it can be assumed at this point Da Vinci's work in Florence had garnered interest throughout Italy.Da Vinci is credited for ushering in the High Renaissance with his Milanese creation** *The Last Supper* **c. 1495-97. Da Vinci's works were also noted for his use of smooth colors that comfort the eyes in addition to his scholarly use of**

**form (Wundram, 2016). His dedication to color and form is evident in this paint Da Vinci's study of anatomy aided in this realistic depiction of Cecilia. This is evidenced in the visible bones and muscles visible in her hand that holds the ermine. Da Vinci, noted for his thousands of anatomy sketches, aptly captures the movement in her hand as it struggles to hold the ermine still, despite the lack of movement elsewhere in her body (Dec & Wałek, n.d.; Vasari, ).** 

- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - a. **Leonardo Da Vinci most notably utilized sketching and his understanding of anatomy to develop his art (Vasari, ). However, as this painting was a portrait, it is likely he sketched an image of Cecilia and later refined the sketch before painting it.**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Ferronniere**
  - b. **Coazzone braid**
  - c. **Sleeve slashing**
  - d. **Mantle**
  - e. **Square neckline**
  - f. **Laced in sleeves**
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?
  - a. **There are no other confirmed illustrations or images of Cecilia.**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - *a.* **This painting objectively marks the beginning of a shift towards High Renaissance works of art. This painting depicts Cecilia in a manner where she is not in the typical profile portrait pose or has distinct markers of the ideal Renaissance wife. Her more relaxed nature, her unadorned beauty speak to a new shift in beauty and purity. Cecilia is depicted without an exceptionally high forehead (a beauty trend in Italy in the 15th century). Dec & Wałek (n.d.) note that Cecilia's dress showcases notes of Spanish influence at a time when Spanish influence on Italian dress was starting to become exceptionally prevalent as the beginning of 16th century approached.**

*Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **What stands out to me is the way that this work features much of Da Vinci's signature skills, while also showcasing some of his less refined skills as this work is representative of some of his earlier works (i.e. line usage). Furthermore, the fact that Da Vinci created a portrait that utilizes very few allegories and contains period appropriate dress stands out when considering his other works.**

- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This work makes me feel at ease due to the serenity displayed in Cecilia's face. This work provides information to aid in responding to my research question.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **This work really speaks to Milanese dress conventions of the period (ferrionniere, coazzone braid, etc), and Renaissance painting/ portrait conventions (torso portrait, natural symbolism, attention to anatomical detail). Da Vinci is widely considered one of the, if not the, more talented Renaissance artist, and as such many of his works embody the key characteristics of Renaissance art.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **The dress in this painting speaks to the evolution of dress in Italy during this period and the cross-cultural influences that are visible in these elements of dress.**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - a. **Cecilia Gallerani was the mistress of Duke Ludovico Sforza (il Moro) prior to his marriage to Beatirce d'Este. Around 1489 Cecilia, aged 16, became mistress of Ludovico, aged 37, despite having no noble blood or standing prior to their affair. She was noted for her intelligence, having been well educated, and beauty while at the Milanese court (Shell & Sironi, 1992). In 1490, Cecilia sat for court painter Leonardo da Vinci for his famed painting**  *Lady with an Ermine.* **Da Vinci's depiction appears to capture a number of the positive characteristics associated with Cecilia while holding the title of his the duke's mistress. Her beauty is evident, while her adoption of court dress is an evident symbolism of how she may have used dress as one way to become more accepted in court. The ferronniere and coazzone braid most clear signify dress styles popular at the Milanese court at the time. Furthermore, the inclusion of the white ermine was a direct natural metaphor for Ludovico himself, who had received the Order of Ermine from the King of Naples in 1488. The ermine also has historic symbolism of purity and beauty, which proves ironic as Cecilia was Ludovico's mistress. Additionally, during the time that this painting was created Cecilia was likely pregnant with her first child by Ludovico, Cesare Sforza Visconti (Dec & Wałek, n.d.). As Ludovico was married to Beatrice d'Este shortly after this painting was created, this portrait was possibly a last public articulation of Ludovico's love for her as the affair was made secret upon Beatrice's arrival at court, and in 1492 Cecilia was wed to Count Lodovic Carminati de Brambilla (Shell & Sironi, 1992). Da Vinci was an apt choice of artist if this**

**was the intention behind the painting as he was noted for his poetic painting style which easily conveyed a range of emotions, including love (Wundram, 2016). Cecilia's gaze is aimed lovingly at something or someone to her right as she holds the ermine (Ludovico) close to her heart.**

  - a. **Giulia is sat on a rock, sitting up straight reaching out to touch the unicorn. Her posture is indicative of being caught mid movement as she turns to the viewer while simultaneously touching the unicorn on the neck, with her finger outstretched to touch his nose.**
- 24. Are other objects or animals included in the image to depict activities, interest, or status,…? How does the sitter engage with these objects?
  - a. **There is a unicorn depicted in the composition with Giulia. It is believed the unicorn is symbolic of Giulia Farnese's family emblem, which included a unicorn. Furthermore, the unicorn is symbolic of purity. As Giulia was notoriously Pope Alexander's mistress, her brother Pope Paul III would likely have wanted to depict his sister in a more positive light.**
- 25. Describe the main elements of clothing for each person in the image in detail, noting the garment category and how it is worn. Also note whether any outdoor clothing.
  - a. **Giulia is depicted wearing a silver/white brocade long mantle that is draped over her far shoulder. She is also wearing a pink natural waist belted outergown with sleeves to her elbow. Her undergown is blue featuring slashings held together by plain gold aiguillettes. Through the slashing is the plain white camicia visible underneath her undergown.**
- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **The mantle that Giulia is wearing is likely a silk brocade. The white/silver color of the mantle is notable as these colors are associated with purity and virtue. Giulia wears a striking pastel pink overgown in the otherwise neutral colored composition.**

- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?
  - a. **The dress of Giulia is not embellished in any overt way.**
- 28. Is any element of dress exaggerated?

  - a. **Giulia wears simple gold aiguillettes to close the slashings on her sleeves, a belt worn at the natural waist, and a string of pearls worn in the ferronière style.**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **The presence of pearls in Giulia's hair and the elegant brocade seen on the mantle are the only overt signifiers of Giulia's rank in society as an upper class woman as these two elements of dress would be financially restricted to those of the upper social classes.**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **The clothing does not serve as an occupational uniform as it is simplified Renaissance dress aiming to appear as the dress if Biblical times.**
- 32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - a. **Giulia does not appear to be wearing any makeup. Giulia's hair is placed in two buns on either side of her head.**
- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **This painting is intended to be a realistically depicted allegorical painting.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **The entire composition is finished an distinguishable.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **This work fits within Renaissance allegorical paintings that showcase Humanist, Mannerist, and Classicism influences. The intricate folds/ details in dress and the accuracy of Giulia's anatomy, the realistically depicted depth and scale of the background all fall within the main characteristics of each of these artistic styles.**
- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **Longhi distinctly defines space within this composition. Giulia and the unicorn sit within the foreground of the composition, while the large tree and grey rocks several yards behind them represent the mid-ground, and the background consists of the grey-blue valley and mountains in the distance. Due to the usage of natural landscape elements as defining objects in the mid and background, there is no interaction between the objects and elements in the foreground (Giulia and the unicorn) and the mid-ground and background.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **Perspective does not appear to be overtly altered or distorted.**

- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **The canvas size is close to if not intended to be life sized. This size could be attributed to the painting likely having been commissioned by her brother Pope Paul III as a way to honor his then late sister in a positive light.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **Space is utilized within the composition to naturally frame the body in subvert ways. The unicorn leaning in towards Giulia frames the right side of the portrait while the background elements (i.e. the mountains, the trees, the rocks, and the valley) provide lines that point towards Giulia and the unicorn.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **Longhi strategically utilizes color to place emphasis on Giulia and the unicorn. The unicorn and Giulia represent the lightest colored elements within the composition, which automatically draws the viewer's eye to these two. The draped bright white/silver of the mantle over Giulia's leg guides the eye to the unicorn, while the muted white of the unicorn and its horn guide the eye back to Giulia and her face. The hint of red in the stone that Giulia sits on provides a sense of balance as it complements the pink of her overgown. The blue of her undergown similarly provides balance with the grey-blue background mountain and valley.**

### *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **Longhi emphasized Giulia and the unicorn. Giulia is intended to represent The Virgin Mary, who is Biblically believed to have tamed the unicorn. This allegorical scene also places emphasis on possibly rewriting Giulia's previous negative identity as the mistress of Pope Alexander (Perez, 2018).**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **The artists uses line and color to place emphasis on these aspects. See Observation questions #39 and #40.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **There appears to be a diamond form (two triangles) within the composition. Giulia and the unicorn appear to encircle each other in their pointing towards each other (Giulia's finger and the unicorn's horn), in addition to Giulia and the unicorn's pointed legs at the bottom right of the composition.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **Color provides a distinct sense of balance. See Observation question #40.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The composition does appear unified in line and color with these elements used to integrate the different spaces within the composition. See Observation questions #36-#40.**

- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **See Reflection question #1. Longhi achieves this in his choice to depict Giulia as the most biblically pure and chaste individual in Catholicism, The Virgin Mary. Similarly, Longhi reiterates Giulia's association with the Farnese family, instead of the Borgia, with the unicorn, a family emblem of the Farnese.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The choice of medium does not impact the work in a material way.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The artist's use of rest does not define the identity of the subject as it is intened to be a heraldically allegorical painting.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **The dress is consistent of Giulia's gender and the age she was at her death, however is inconsistent with her class/ status as it is a contemporary interpretation of biblical dress.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The dress of Giulia in this painting is inconsistent with the period in which the work was commissioned. Instead the dress was more consistent with dress of an Italian woman of her status in the early to mid-15th century.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The garments the Giulia wears are consistent with period depictions of The Virgin Mary in other allegorical/ biblical scenes. The Virgin Mary is typically portrayed in a simple gown with a mantle. However, the aiguilettes and sleeve slashing are contemporary stylistic additions to the composition that reflect Italian Renaissance dress elements. The string of pearls worn in Giulia's hair also hint towards contemporary style elements, as The Virgin Mary is frequently depicted in Renaissance portraiture with her head veiled and/or with a halo above her head. Finally, the fact that Giulia is depicted with her hair up indicates a departure from the typical allegorical/ biblical depictions of The Virgin Mary as throughout the Renaissance hair being worn braided or in an up-do was an indication of a woman's martial status.**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The clothing Giulia wears is intended to conceal her body and in conjunction her modesty. Only her hands, neck, and face are visible, however Longhi creates the illusion of a more subtle modesty as he drapes her in voluminous fabrics that aid in concealing her body.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **It is unknown if the artist has taken liberties in the visual representation of the sitter.**

- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This work was examined to identify the manner in which Giulia Farnese's identity in life may or may not have impacted her post-mortem depictions and identity.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **I do not have any emotive reaction to this image.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My personal reactions do not indicate a shift in cultural beliefs.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I cannot identify a personal connection with this work. However, I am biased in the preconceived knowledge that Giulia Farnese was the mistress to the Pope and frequently depicted in a negative light as such (the Pope was suppose to be chaste).**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series? a. **This work appears to be a single work.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - a. *The Holy Family with Saint Anne and the Infant Saint John the Baptist, 1573***: This later work by Longhi depicts another biblical scene in which The Virgin Mary is seen in a pink plain gown that is belted at the waist with a blue mantle laid across her lap. This consistent depiction and use of color in The Virgin's dress could speak to a period or artistic convention in the depiction of The Virgin. However, the discrepancy lies with the way The Virgin's hair is styled compared to Giulia's. In this 1578 painting The Virgin's hair is parted down the middle and covered with a veil, signifying her modest and chaste nature. Opposingly, Giulia, in the place of The Virgin Mary, is depicted with no such head covering and her hair in an up-do as previously outlined.**
  - b. *The Madonna and Child with the Infant John the Baptist in a Landscape, c. 1525-1549***: This work, created closer in date to the one under analysis, shows The Madonna wearing a gown of the same color and similar style that of Giulia as The Virgin. The blue mantle is similar to other depicts of The Virgin created by Longhi, but differs from the white/silver intricate brocade mantle Giulia is seen wearing, hinting at the fact that the allegorical scene is not actually intended to depict The Virgin, but rather Giulia emulating The Virgin as she is bedecked in subtle showcases of finery that are inconsistent with depictions and characterizations of The Virgin. Contrastingly to other depictions of The Virgin in Longhi's works, this c. 1525-1549 painting depicts her with her hair in a braided up-do and a barely there sheer veil. While this is likely indicative of Longhi's effort to depict a more realistic Madonna, it should be noted that not all biblical depictions of The Virgin/ The Madonna feature such a conservative veil.**

- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?
  - **a. Luca de' Longhi of Ravenna was noted by Vasari ( ) for his "very beautiful panel-pictures in oils and portraits from nature" (p. 154). Longhi was noted for his immense skill accumulated from the study of prints of other Renaissance master's works. However, Longhi's reputation and lack of international renown was limited as he was known for not frequently leaving Ravenna (Trerè, n.d.).**
- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - **a. According to Castel Sant'Angelo, the composition was taken from a sketch by Da Vinci which is currently held at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - **a. Aiguilettes**
  - **b. Outergown**
  - **c. Undergown**
  - **d. Camicia**
  - **e. Mantle**
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?
  - a. **See Reflection question #19.**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **The choice to depict Giulia as emulating The Virgin Mary/ The Madonna is consistent with the shift of feminine ideas of virtue and humbleness that sprung up within the Christian community at the beginning of the 16th century. With the numerous branches of Christianity emerging as alternatives to the perceived corruption of the Catholic Church at the end of the 15th century, it would be advantageous to depict the previous mistress of the Pope as reformed and chaste, similar to the Madonna.**

*Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **The depiction of Giulia as a slightly off-kilter The Virgin. She is depicted as if to emulate The Virgin, but she still features elements of what would have been Giulia's identity in life (married, wealthy, a Farnese, etc).**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This work is consistent with other portraits under analysis in an effort to answer my research question.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?

- a. **The work showcases Longhi's talent with landscapes/backgrounds, as mentioned by Vasari, and how Longhi both adheres and deviates from period visual traditions of the depiction of The Virgin Mary/ Madonna.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **The depiction of dress in this work is inconsistent with dress of the period, as it is intended to represent a biblical scene.**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - a. **This allegorical biblical scene of The Virgin Mary (Giulia Farnese) luring in the unicorn features a number of social and political. Giulia Farnese was born into the noble Farnese family in 1474. In May of 1489, Giulia married Orsino Orsini and spent much of the early years of her marriage in her mother-in-law's household in Rome (Fresu, 2019). Giulia would go on to become the mistress of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia at the age of 16 years old. Then two years later, in 1492, Borgia was elected to the papacy and became Pope Alexander VI, making Giulia the first open mistress of a pope. Throughout Giulia's relationship with the Pope she lived in the Vatican alongside his daughter Lucrezia. Giulia is believed to have birthed the Pope a daughter (although the girls parentage is disputed) in 1492, further solidifying her position in the eyes of the Catholic people as "concubine of the Pope"(p. 96) as described by Johan Burchard, the Pope's master of ceremonies. The Pope's highly visible relationship with Giulia was part of the beginning of Borgia and papacy's reputation and association with depravity. However, despite this less than admirable association, through Giulia's relationship with the Pope she attained a cardinal position for her brother Alessandro, who would go on to become Pope Paul III in 1534 (Strathern, 2019).**

**This painting, which now hangs in the Castel Sant'Angelo was likely commissioned by Pope Paul III not long after his ascension to the papacy in 1534 (as the painting is dated between 1535 and 1540). It would make sense that such a portrait would be commissioned to restructure Giulia's public image as another Farnese entered the Vatican. However, the portrait, as it were would have been created at least 11 years after her death.**

- 9. Has this work been altered in some way from its original state?
  - a. **A portion of the bottom of the sketch was removed at some point by a few centimeters. An old copy of this original work held in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford indicates that the missing few centimeters showcased Isabella's arm on the left side of the portrait pointing to her other arm that is resting on a book ("Portrait d'Isabelle d'Este," n.d.).**
- 10. Where is the emphasis in the image?
  - a. **The emphasis is on the gown worn by Isabella.**
- 11. What captures your attention first?
  - a. **The blue sleeves of Isabella's gown capture my attention first.**
- 12. How many persons are included in the artwork?
  - a. **There is one person in this work.**
- 13. Are the figures in the artwork known persons? Is the work intended as a portrait? Can they be identified by name? If so, this knowledge of their identity inform your analysis?
  - a. **The person in this work is Isabella d'Este, Marchioness of Mantua. The knowledge of her identity aids in analyzing elements of symbolism within the work.**

- 16. Is the setting indoors or outdoors?
  - a. **The setting is undefined as this is intended to be a compositional sketch.**
- 17. Does the artwork depict a specific place or setting?
  - a. **See Observation question #16**
- 18. What elements of the setting or background are notable?

## a. **See Observation question #16**

## a. **See Observation question #16**

20. Are the people in the artwork clothed? If not, are the naked bodies ornamented or fashioned in some way?

### a. **Isabella is clothed.**

- 21. How are the people oriented (front facing, three-quarter view, profile, or back facing)? Consider what this orientation signifies.
  - a. **Isabella is sat in a ¾ position with her head in profile. This style would be inconsistent with period aristocratic portraits in Italy of the time which were primarily in profile. This choice is believed to possibly indicate Da Vinci's desire to break tradition ("Portrait d'Isabelle d'Este," n.d.).**
- 22. What is the gender of each person in the image? Has the artist emphasized gender or obscured it?
  - a. **Isabella is a woman. Her gender is emphasized through her dress.**
- 23. Consider the posture of the sitter(s). Are they seated, standing, or reclining? Are parts of the body not visible in the image? Is their posture rigid or relaxed? Is posture indicative of state of mind and/or training of the body?
  - a. **Isabella is depicted in an almost candid position with her arms crossed and face away from the viewer as if speaking to someone out of view. This casual seated position and yet her remaining formal posture, for example squared pushed back shoulders and straight unslouched back aid in indicating Isabella's formal and aristocratic upbringing.**
- 24. Are other objects or animals included in the image to depict activities, interest, or status,…? How does the sitter engage with these objects?
  - a. **[For the purpose of this work we will be referencing the Ashmolean Museum Oxford's copy of this portrait,**

**[https://collections.ashmolean.org/collection/search/per\\_page/25/offset/0/sort\\_](https://collections.ashmolean.org/collection/search/per_page/25/offset/0/sort_by/relevance/object/162819) [by/relevance/object/162819,](https://collections.ashmolean.org/collection/search/per_page/25/offset/0/sort_by/relevance/object/162819) to describe the missing section of this original Da Vinci sketch as described by the Louvre in the object description ("Portrait d'Isabelle d'Este," n.d.).] The original version of this painting, prior to the bottom half of the sketch being trimmed off, included a table along the bottom, with a book sat on the table. Isabella indicates toward the book with her outstretched hand, while her arm is rested on the table.** 

- 25. Describe the main elements of clothing for each person in the image in detail, noting the garment category and how it is worn. Also note whether any outdoor clothing.
  - a. **Isabella is depicted in an extremely wide necked gown blue stripes and voluminous sleeves that are gathered into the armscye. In detailed images**

**there is evidence of ribbons that near the armscye which would have been used to tie the sleeve into the bodice's armscye. She also appears to be wearing a white camicia underneath her gown that is visible at the neckline.** 

- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **As this is intended to be compositional/ preliminary sketch of a never completed portrait, the textiles are not rendered in this drawing. However, notably Da Vinci includes pastel coloring in this sketch. The camicia appears to be white with gold vertical stripes and a gold band across the top and her gown is blue with blue vertical stripes.**
- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?
  - a. **The edge of Isabella's camicia appears to feature some sort of embroidery or braided looping attached to the gold band. The gold stripes of the camicia are likely a form of embellishment or embroidery.**
- 28. Is any element of dress exaggerated?
  - a. **The dress does not appear to be exaggerated in any notable way.**
- 29. Describe the accessories of each person…Note how they are worn, carried, or placed in the image.
  - a. **Isabella is illustrated with the faint beginnings of an elaborate ferronière on her head.**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **There are no obvious signifiers of rank in Isabella's accessories. However, her ferrioniere could be a indicator of her social status as a member of the aristocracy.**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **The extremely wide neckline of Isabella's gown can be referenced as an indicator of her class as this style was becoming popular amongst the aristocracy in Italy at the turn of the 15th century.**
- 32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - a. **Isabella's hair is wore down and free with a ferronière placed across her forehead in her hair.**
- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **This portrait is realistic.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **Numerous elements of the image are unfinished and indistinguishable due to the nature of this preliminary sketch.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **The work fits within the early period of the High Renaissance, which consisted of the Humanist movement. Da Vinci was renowned for his grasp of the human body and as such, and conveyed in this image, he was a talented artist within both of these movements. Elements of this portrait that showcase key tenants of Humanism are the details in the sleeves of Isabella's gown (the realistic creases, pleats, and overall drape) and the tendons and**

### **bones visible in her hand and fingers as she points towards the no longer visible book.**

- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **As this is a preliminary sketch there is no clear distinction of space in the sense of fore, mid, and background. However, the original un-trimmed version of this painting, included a table/ ledge and book that sat in the foreground, in which Isabella's hands were used to connect the foreground and midground, in which the rest of her body resides within the composition. The background then effectively becomes anything behind Isabella.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **Perspective does not appear to be distorted or altered in any visible way.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **This portrait is close to if not actually human sized. This likely was intended to best document Isabella's features in the preliminary sketch and may or may not have been this same size were this work transferred to canvas and completed.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **As there is an absence of any background elements the paper itself is utilized to frame Isabella's body. The manner in which her left side falls off the page creates the illusion that this work is a snapshot or candid portrait (i.e. less formal). The table/ ledge in the un-cut version of this portrait creates a lower frame within the composition that aids in balancing the eye back up to Isabella's form, instead of allowing her body to fade into the bottom of the paper. The lines of Isabella's gown aid in filling the space of the composition being both voluminous and covered in pleat, crease, and drape lines that guide the viewer's eye from Isabela's crossed arms to her neck and face.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The light use of color in this sketch directly draws the viewer's eyes to Isabella's garments. The blue of her sleeves, and the prominent blue stripes of her bodice immediately draw the viewer's attention. Then the abundance of pastel blue is balanced with the vibrant gold band and lines of Isabella's camicia, which draw the eyes up from her sleeves and crossed arms to her neck and face.**

### *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **Da Vinci emphasized the dress of Isabella. This was likely in an effort to convey her status without the overt use of jewels or other distinctive luxurious objects.**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc? a. **See Observation questions #39 and #40.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?

- a. **There does not appear to be any obvious pattern or rhythm as the composition is incomplete.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **The artist has chosen to destabilize the composition through the manner in which Isabella is positioned. Her head is firmly directed to the side while the rest of her body is outturned, with her hands and fingers pointing in opposite directions. Furthermore, Da Vinci's use detail is unbalanced as Isabella's gown and lower torso feature more detail in rendering than her upper body area, such as her head and neck. However, Da Vinci's use of color is balanced.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The composition appears unified through Da Vinci's use of color and line (see Observation questions #39 and #40).**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **I think Da Vinci is trying to convey the simplistic beauty and candid everyday look of Isabella. He achieves this by not depicting Isabella in a regal manner (formal profile portrait) or extravagant dress.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The choice of medium for this preliminary sketch impacts the clarity of the composition. As this drawing was created with charcoal and colored chalk, and not oil or tempera, the composition does not appear as vibrant as other depictions of Isabella or paintings.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The manner in which Isabella's arms are crossed and her hand is draped towards the book in addition to her straight posture hint at her aristocratic status.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **The visible camicia, very wide neckline, and voluminous sleeves are indicators of her gender, age, and class.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The wide neckline and exposed camicia are slightly ahead of their time in terms of style, as the wide neck and exposed camicia did not gain widespread popularity until the first part of the 16th century. The ferronière is consistent with the time period, especially considering Isabella's sister Bianca**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The ferronière is an iconic Northern Italian style for women at the end of the 15th century.**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The large sleeves give the appearance of Isabella creating an imposing presence. The low wide neckline reveals Isabella's upper chest.**

- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **It does not appear that Da Vinci took any liberties in his depiction of Isabella that may have altered or distorted her appearance.**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This work was analyzed to analyze the dress identity of Isabella d'Este.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **I do not have any emotive reaction to this image.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My personal reaction does not have any connection to cultural beliefs.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I can not identify any bias or personal connection to this work.**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **This is part of an unofficial series as it believed to be the first of several sketches created in an effort to plan a portrait for Isabella.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - a. *Lady with an Ermine, 1490***: This portrait was created by Da Vinci several years prior to the one under analysis, and likely inspired Isabella to request a portrait of her own from Da Vinci as she borrowed the 1490 portrait of Cecilia Gallerani. The body position is similar in both portraits creating a more intimate depiction of each woman, in comparison to the traditional profile portraits.**
  - b. *Mona Lisa, 1502-1516:* **This work is similar to this portrait of Isabella as it depicts a similarly garbed woman (wide neckline, over-gown and undergown), and both women are depicted lacking in any overt uses of jewelry as status markers. Similarly, both women are depicted in very candid and less formal manners than traditional royal/court portraits of the period. This speaks to Da Vinci's emphasis on Mannerism.**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?
  - a. **Vasari ( ) speaks of Da Vinci's talent and works as if describing a poetic master of all arts. Da Vinici is also noted for his excellent use of colors and the technique of chiaroscuro. Da Vinci is credited for ushering in the High Renaissance with his Milanese creation** *The Last Supper* **c. 1495-97. Da Vinci's works were also noted for his use of smooth colors that comfort the eyes in addition to his scholarly use of form (Wundram, 2016). His dedication to color and form is beginning to become apparent in this preliminary sketch. Da Vinci's study of anatomy aided in this realistic depiction of**

**Isabella as well. This is evidenced in the visible bones and muscles visible in her hand.** 

- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - a. **Leonardo Da Vinci most notably utilized sketching and his understanding of anatomy to develop his art (Vasari, ). As this sketch is believed to be the first of several studies of Isabella for the purpose of creating a portrait, one can assume that this sketch was created from life.**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Visible Camicia**
  - b. **Wide neckline**
  - c. **Voluminous/ puffed/ Baragoni (?) sleeves**
  - d. **Ferronière**
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?
  - a. **See other portraits of Isabella d'Este under analysis.**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **This painting objectively marks the beginning of a shift towards High Renaissance works of art. This work depicts Isabella in a manner where she is not in the typical profile portrait pose or has distinct markers of the ideal Renaissance wife. Her more relaxed nature, her unadorned beauty speak to a new shift in beauty and purity. Isabella is depicted without an exceptionally high forehead (a beauty trend in Italy in the 15th century).**

## *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **The lack of adornment or gown style that is slightly ahead of its time really stands out, and could speak to Isabella's true personal identity in private.**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This work aids in answering my research question in relation to Isabella d'Este's dress identity.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **This work speaks to Da Vinci's detail and dedication to his preliminary sketches and composition sketches. While he is known for anatomy sketches this sketch shows another level of completion in which there are layers to the garments and even color included.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **This depiction of Isabella in the wide necked gown with the exposed camicia speaks to dramatic changes in Italian womenswear during the period..**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that

framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.

a. **Isabella d'Este born was born in May 1474 to Duke Ercole d'Este and Duchess Eleonora of Aragon. In 1490, she married Francesco Gonzaga, the fourth Marchese of Mantua. Notably, her younger sister Beatrice married Lodovico Sforza, who was the lover of Cecilia Gallerani, the subject of Da Vinci's** *Lady with the Ermine* **painting (Isabella asked to borrow the painting c. 1491 and Cecilia had it sent to Mantua for several months). Throughout her reign, as both a D'Este and Gonzaga Isabella frequently travelled to different courts in Italy, and fostered a an interest and patronage in the arts. By the time of this portrait, Isabella had yet to birth her husband a male heir, which could likely be indicative of why the portrait lacks many of the period symbolism of dutiful aristocratic wives (i.e. emphasis on the stomach, pomegranate motif, etc). Isabella had birthed a daughter in 1493, Leonora and another daughter in 1496, Margherita (who would die several months later). However, by 1500 Isabella had given birth to a son Federico. Despite the early struggles of providing a legitimate male heir, Francesco and Isabella were documented to have had a happy marriage and home (Cockram, 2013). The happy marriage could also be owed in part to tha fact that the D' Este family was a more high-profile Italian aristocrats, with Isabella's mother having royal blood, which would lend further legitimacy and importance to the Gonzaga dynasty. This could in part be an explanation for the freedom in which Isabella experienced in her marriage, freedom to travel, freedom in spending, and most importantly her freedom to govern in her husband's absence, and at his side when present (James, 2012).**

- 13. Are the figures in the artwork known persons? Is the work intended as a portrait? Can they be identified by name? If so, this knowledge of their identity inform your analysis?
  - a. **The woman in the portrait is Isabella d'Este . This information aids in identifying dress identity indicators and other forms of symbolism within the portrait.**
- 14. If there is more than one person, what is their physical position relative to each other? Does their position, posture, or body language echo their relationship?
  - a. **There is only one person in this portrait.**
- 15. Where is their gaze directed?

# a. **Isabella's gaze is directed out to the viewer and slightly to the left.**

- 16. Is the setting indoors or outdoors?
  - a. **The setting is inside.**
- 17. Does the artwork depict a specific place or setting?
  - a. **The background does not depict a specific place or setting as it appears to be simply dark green draped fabric.**

- 18. What elements of the setting or background are notable?
  - a. **There are no notable/ significant elements of the background.**
- 19. Does the setting convey status, privilege, or other meaning?
  - a. **The studio-like background indicates a level of privileged access to the artist, a status reserved for wealth patrons such as Isabella.**
- 20. Are the people in the artwork clothed? If not, are the naked bodies ornamented or fashioned in some way?
  - a. **Isabella is clothed.**
- 21. How are the people oriented (front facing, three-quarter view, profile, or back facing)? Consider what this orientation signifies.
  - a. **Isabella is posed in a 3/4th angle towards the left side of the portrait. This type of orientation in addition to profile orientations were traditional for Italian Renaissance portraits, specifically those of the aristocracy.**
- 22. What is the gender of each person in the image? Has the artist emphasized gender or obscured it?
  - a. **Isabella is a woman.**
- 23. Consider the posture of the sitter(s). Are they seated, standing, or reclining? Are parts of the body not visible in the image? Is their posture rigid or relaxed? Is posture indicative of state of mind and/or training of the body?
  - a. **Isabella is seated with her back and shoulders straight and regal, with her right arm stiffly posed on the arm of the chair, and her other arm and hand clenched in her lap. The rigid nature of her posture speaks to a history of etiquette training, which would align with the education Isabella would have received as the daughter of a duke and duchess.**
- 24. Are other objects or animals included in the image to depict activities, interest, or status,…? How does the sitter engage with these objects?
  - a. **The only non dress related object present in the composition was the wooden chair in which Isabella sits.**
- 25. Describe the main elements of clothing for each person in the image in detail, noting the garment category and how it is worn. Also note whether any outdoor clothing.
  - a. **She wears a black gown with a low cut square neckline, in which her white camicia is visible. Her camicia has a white long collar with embroidered dark green ribbon which drapes over her chest. The sleeves of her outer gown are black and the baragoni style. Isabella's under gown is visible only at the sleeves, which are green and brocade/ embroidered, in which a slightly fitted style is present. Her camicia is also visible poking out the cuffs of her under gown sleeves. Finally Isabella wears an ermine stole draped over her right shoulder.**
- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **Isabella's under gown is made of a green brocade/ embroidered fabric. Whlie her outergown fabric is indistinguishable, it is likely that her camicia is made of silk or a fine linen based on Isabella's status and wealth.**
- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?

- a. **Her camicia features blackwork at the sleeve cuffs and collar, and has gold embroidered ribbon trims attached on the tie collar and the body of the camicia. Her undergown is embroidered at the sleeves, while any surface texture/ embellishment on her outergown is indistinguishable due to the condition of the painting overtime. The pattern on her undergown sleeves, known as the fantasie dei vinci was said to be invented by Niccolò di Correggio for Isabella and her sister Beatrice (Clayton & Whitaker, ).**
- 28. Is any element of dress exaggerated?
  - a. **No element of dress appears to be exaggerated.**
- 29. Describe the accessories of each person…Note how they are worn, carried, or placed in the image.
  - a. **Isabella wears a white ermine stole draped over her right shoulder, diamond pearl drop shaped earrings, and a turban-like headdress with a gold brooch pinned to the center front. The headdress features green and gold ribbons braided into the back, and an overall off white color. The brooch includes a black square gem in the center with eight white pearls surrounding it. Isabella appears to be holding some form of jewelry in her left hand, likely a rosary.**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **The presence of the long ermine stole speaks to Isabella's wealth, as this specific type of fur was exceptionally expensive and rare. Furthermore, the extensive brocade/ embroidery on her under gown sleeves also speak to a level of exceptional wealth. This paired with the large jeweled brooch on her headdress all point towards the type of wealth displayed in dress that was likely typical throughout Isabella's life.**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
- a. **The dress of Isabella indicates her identity as a member of the aristocracy.**  32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - a. **Isabella's hair is parted down the middle and pulled back into the turbanlike headdress. Some of her hair falls in spiral curls out of the headdress to** 
    - **frame her face. Isabella does not appear to be wearing any makeup on her face.**
- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **This image is realistic.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **Certain elements of Isabella's outergown are indistinguishable likely due to a combination of the degradation of the painting over time and the black color of the gown.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **This work is consistent with High Renaissance Mannerist works that Titian is frequently noted for. This portrait's use of detail in rendering the embroidery on her garments, the fine hairs of the ermine stole and the realistic gleam of Isabella's eyes all speak to the heightened attention of beauty and detail present in Mannerist works.**

- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **The background is defined by the dark green draped fabric, while the midground features a majority of Isabella's body, with her right hand reaching into the slight foreground as it rests on the arm of the wooden chair in which she sits. It is difficult to clearly distinguish between the foreground and the midground as they appear to be intertwined, while the background does not interact with these other spaces as it exists completely behind Isabella's back.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **Perspective does not appear to be altered in any notable way.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **Dependent on Isabella's actual height this painting can be perceived to be very close to her actual size. This creates a very imposing perspective of Isabella in that she is depicted in life size with garments close to that of ones that she would have worn in life.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **Isabella is tightly framed within the composition by the confines of the canvas. The lines of her under-gown sleeves define the edges of her person in vivid color and aid in drawing the eyes towards her clenched left hand and her casually draped right hand, while also inadvertently gesturing towards the bottom of her stole. Similarly the lines of the hanging tie collar of her camicia also point towards the ermine stole. The use of line to emphasize this element of her dress is likely indicative of conveying Isabella's remaining wealth and status, even as a dowager and widow.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **Titian uses color sparingly in this composition, with dark colors dominating the portrait. In this, the few light hues that are present draw attention to specific objects. For example, as previously mentioned the white ermine stole dotted with black spots (which indicates its nature as ermine fur) is a focal point within the portrait. Additionally, Isabella's white camicia draws the eye its featured gold and green embroidery. The black color of her outer-gown is likely a choice intended to bring attention to the colorful and intricately decorated sleeves of her under-gown. Similarly, the off-white colored turbanlike headdress that Isabella wears stands out the in equal measure as its light hue and jeweled brooch are prominent likely for their display of wealth and contemptuous style for the region.**

### *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **The artist emphasized Isabella's dress in an effort to highlight elements of her identity, including her wealth and status as a widow.**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?

- a. **Titian utilizes line, color, and space to emphasize these elements. See Observation questions #38-40.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **The underlying pattern relates to the multiple uses of line and linear shapes as described in Observation question #39.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **The sense of balance is achieved in this composition through Titian's use of color. Additionally, the positioning of Isabella creates an illusion of compositional imbalance as the angle of her body and the ermine stole on her right shoulder balances the composition towards the right side of the canvas.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The composition is unified and integrated utilizing both line and color as explained in Observation questions #39 and #40.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **I believe Titian was attempting to convey the status, wealth and beauty of Isabella, despite her being in her later stage of life. He attempts to achieve this in his youthful depiction of Isabella and in the abundance of wealthy dress elements.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The choice of medium does not impact the work in a material way.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The positioning of Isabell within tbe wooden chair is a tease depiction of a position that should otherwise be relaxed. This is highly indicative of her royal upbringing and likely years of etiquette lessons of how to be an aristocratic lady. In this she would have learned to sit straight, with her shoulders back and head held high, with her hands in formal poses (in her lap or on the sides of a chair).**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **The dress of Isabella is consistent with her gender, class/occupation. This depiction of Isabella shows her with her camicia revealing significantly less of her skin than earlier portraits, which showcases an attempt to be consistent with the dress of Isabella's actual age of 60-62.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The garments are stylistically consistent with the period and region.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The turban like headdress (zazara) that Isabella is wearing along with the large baragoni sleeves we're both very popular styles in the early to mid 16th century. Specifically wealthy women of the Mantua region wore similar head dresses.**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?

- a. **The garments and accessories Isabella is wearing disguise much of her body in a way that would be appropriate for a woman her age (60-62) and of her status as a dowager widow.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **Titian has decided to depict Isabella as being in her teens-20s, possibly in an effort to preserve the youthful Isabella that had such an impact on arts, fashion, and culture at the height of her reign with her husband. This is in contrast to the real Isabella at the time of this portrait who would have been a widow for a little over a decade and been between he ages of 60 and 62.**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **I examined this work in an effort to analyze the dress identity and status conveyed in depictions of Isabella throughout her life.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **I do not have any emotive reaction to this image.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My personal reactions do not indicate a shift in cultural beliefs.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I can not identify any personal connection or bias that should be acknowledged in this work.**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series? a. **This is a single work.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - a. **Titian created another portrait of Isabella during the 1530s that has been lost to history, but was copied by Rubens between 1600-1601 (analyzed in this research). Based on the Rubens copy this work depicts Isabella in a significantly more colorful and voluminous ensemble. This could indicate that both portraits had a very different message, one with all its dark colors and more youthful appearance could indicate an idealized image of the old widow, while the more colorful depiction copied by Rubens conveys Isabella at her physical age, but in an ensemble more befitting her younger prewidow years. Both paintings feature her staple wide neckline and turban-like headdress, showing at least consistency in her dress appearance.**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?
  - a. **"Titian's genius is balancing vivid likeness, conceived with a distinctly Venetian sensitivity to the sensuous evocation of tactile substance, with brilliant artistic device to convey the salient character traits and authority that his sitters possessed—or aspired to – made him one of the greatest**

**portraitists of all times," (Goldfarb, Freedberg, & Mena Marqués, 1998, p. 3). Titian was noted for his depiction of numerous powerful individuals throughout his lifetime including Charles V, Isabella of Portugal, and Philip II to name a few (Goldfarb, Freedberg, & Mena Marqués, 1998). Titian studied under Giovanni Bellini, who was similarly contracted by Isabella's son Federico Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua to complete several commissions (Bensusan, 2013). In addition for Titian's high profile portraiture patrons, he was noted for his landscapes, religious images, and allegorical paintings, with his use of color being the most prominent feature, going on to inspire artists like Manet due to his rich and varied use of colors, unseen in other High Renaissance works. He was noted for his use of color transcending his use of color, allowing for figures to blend together. In a way this is seen with the manner in which the ermine stole blends with the outer gown, and the outergown blends with the background (Wundram, 2016). Vasari ( ) notes Titian's skill at rendering flesh and hair, evidenced in Isabella's face (despite having to work from an older portrait) and the strands of hair on the ermine stole.** 

- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - a. **Bensusan (2013) and Clayton and Whitaker ( ) claim that this portrait was copied/ inspired by a portrait of Isabella commissioned when she was younger, as by this time she refused to sit for any paintings that would feature her advanced age. Titian was noted for his lack of sketching, and immediate painting with colors on canvas (Vasari, ).**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Ermine fur**
  - b. **Ermine stole**
  - c. **Zazara (turban-like headdress)**
  - d. **Camicia**
  - e. **Outergown**
  - f. **Undergown**
  - g. **Baragoni sleeves**
  - h. **Fantasie dei vinci**
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?

### a. **See other portraits under analysis.**

- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **This portrait speaks to both the value of Titian's commission and the perspective a dowager widow such as Isabella has. As was typical of widows of previous periods, Isabella would have worn all black and a mourning veil after her husband's death until she died or remarried. However, due to her position, as the mother of a recently appointed duke and the daughter of**

### **another duke, in addition to her reputation with in European politics and arts she likely was allowed some flexibility in her dress identity.**

### *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **The youthful appearance of Isabella in combination with her more conservative dress identity than when she was younger stands out within this composition. Additionally, such color present in this depiction is striking as she was a widow by this time.**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This work aids in identifying the different dress identities and persona Isabella wished to convey through portraiture in different periods of her life.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **This work speaks to Titian's High Renaissance influenced ability to capture detail and render it in a realistic manner. This is evidenced in the delicate brushstrokes that evoke the illusion of three-dimensional fur, in addition to the embroidered gold collar of her camicia that catches the light and almost looks real.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **The depiction of dress in this work speaks to the power and influence that Isabella had on dress in Mantua and as a result in the broader environment of Northern Europe as her zazara headdress was thought to be popularized across Europe by her. Fashion, as evidenced by this portrait was used to convey status and wealth in a very overt manner (ex. The ermine stole).**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - a. **This portrait, while featuring the face of Isabella most likely around 1500, it contrastingly features garments and dress styles of the 1530s, indicating that while Titian was likely instructed by Isabella to base her face off of a previous portrait, he took inspiration for her dress from her dress identity of the 1530s (Bensusan, 2013; Clayton & Whitaker, 2008). Isabella is said to have written in a letter commenting on this portrait that " we doubt whether, at the age at which he represents us, we were as beautiful as the picture," (p. 136) implying that the alteration in her age was not the only liberty in which she asked Titian to take with her appearance (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008). This is an especially poignant point as by the time of this portrait the 60-62 year old Isabella's husband Francesco had been dead 15-17 years (d. 1519) (Cockram, 2013). As such while Isabella is depicted in a black outergown she appears to be asserting her identity outside of widowhood through the evidence of color on her undergown sleeves, the ermine stole, and her staple**

**zazara. This would be especially important as several years prior to this painting's commission her son had been made the 1st Duke of Mantua. Throughout her marriage to Francesco she had established her own independent identity as a marchioness, known for her international influence on fashion, art, and politics (Cockram, 2013). This portrait makes evident that despite losing her position as a marchioness following her husband's death in 1519, she remained a beacon for fashion, style, and beauty at the Court of Mantua, even if that meant having her likeness presented in current fashions with her immortally youthful face, in spite of her actual age.**

The sleeve of the red gown are in the baragoni style in which they become more tailored after the upper arm. The lower half of the gown sleeves are encircled with a gold ribbon, and the cuffs of the sleeves are trimmed in brown fur. The waist of the gown is emphasized through the straight waistline and pleats .**
- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **The textiles of the gown are not very clear, however the sleeve trim is distinctly fur in the ribbons around the sleeve are made of woven gold.

  - a. **The image appears to be a realistic image.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **The painting appears to be complete with all elements distinguishable.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **The artwork most closely fits within late renaissance and early baroque art. Rubens was considered a renaissance man but his work was considered baroque in nature. This is evident in the consistency of the composition being within the frame of the mannerist movement within the Renaissance, however numerous details of the painting do not fit with the heightened attention to anatomical correctness and detail in dress such as folds and the rendering of textiles. This fits closer within the baroque period in which these things were not deemed as important as there was an emphasis on shape size and space. Furthermore the lack of a consistent light source is more consistent with baroque artistic styles then renaissance.**
- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?

- a. **Rubens creates a slight sense of space in this otherwise flat and work. Isabella is distinctly in the midground/ foreground with her left hand slightly jutting into what could be assumed to be the foreground.

- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **Space has been used to frame the composition in a way that focuses only on Isabella's body and no background elements. The sleeves of isabelle's gown either overflow off the canvas or almost to the edge of the canvas making it appear as if Isabella is almost too large for the frame. Similarly the lower half of isabel's body is cut off by the bottom half of the canvas and her zazara reaches almost the top of the canvas. With no background elements present in this composition Isabella's garments and accessories are utilized to frame her body within the composition.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The large presence of red within this composition draws attention to the large forms within the composition such as her voluminous gown sleeves and pleated skirt. Complementing the abundance of red within the composition is the presence of the eye capturing white camicia that is trimmed in a balancing gold. The white camicia Aids in drawing the eyes to the Pearl necklace around isabelle's neck which thus brings the eye up to her pale white face. A similar use of color for movement can be seen with the gold ribbon on her camicia In which the vertical lines point towards the gold braid girdle around her waist which could be hinting towards fertility. The gold ribbons on her sleeve called back to the gold on her camicia and the girdle in an effort to further balance the composition. All of these colors, red, gold, and white, are all present in isabella's zazara tying together all of the colors present within the composition**

### *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **Rubens appears to emphasize the voluminous nature of the numerous elements of isabel's dress and accessories. This could signify a desire to showcase isabella's wealth, style, and power within her lifetime.**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?

- a. **The artist emphasizes these aspects using scale, line, and color. See observation questions # 39 and 40.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **There appears to be an underlying linear pattern between the neck and waist of isabel's form. The linear ribbons from her camicia Point towards her waist while the pleats from her skirt and the ribbons on her sleeve similarly point towards the waist in the opposite direction this could be indicative subtle hint towards fertility. The rosary Pearl necklace an girdle that Isabella wears all appear to line up with the center front of isabella's gown and body.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **The sense of balance the artist has created is in large part due to color well his use of space is slightly unbalanced due to the content heavy nature of the lower half of the portrait with the presence of Isabella's voluminous gown.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The composition does appear unified due to the artists use of color. Furthermore Isabella is positioned in a way that her body appears symmetrical. As all the elements in the portrait involve isabella's body it is fair to say that they are integrated.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **I believe the artist was trying to showcase isabella's wealth and style within this portrait as away to promote two of her chief identities from life. The artist achieves this in his depiction of her dress and accessories.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The choice of medium does not impact the work in a material way.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The way in which Isabella stands with her shoulders straight back straight and one arm outstretched showcasing her ring, in addition to her relatively straight neck despite her large headdress are all indicative of her high socioeconomic class and likely her etiquette lessons as the daughter of a Duke and Duchess.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation? a. **The dress of Isabella is consistent with her gender and social class.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **As this portrait is a copy of a Titian painting that was created within isabella's lifetime it can be said that the dress is consistent with the dress of the period in which Isabella lived.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The zazara that Isabella is wearing along with the large baragoni sleeves we're both very popular styles in the early to mid 16th century. Specifically wealthy women of the Mantua region wore similar head dresses.**

- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The clothing Isabella is wearing aids in both concealing and revealing her body. The low neckline and visible camicia exposes her upper chest, while her voluminous sleeves conceal much of her body and at the same time accentuate her waist.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **It does not appear the artist took visual liberties with the depiction of Isabella.**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This work was examined to identify elements of Isabella's dress identity conveyed in portraiture.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?

a.

- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My personal reaction has no connection to shifts in cultural beliefs.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I cannot identify any personal connection or bias in this research.**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **This work is a copy of a Titian painting, however it is a single work created by Rubens.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison
  - a. **As this is a copy of a Titian work from the 16th century, Rubens does not have any portraits similar to this (as his portrait more strictly follow Baroque portraiture conventions).**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?
  - **a. Ruben's work was notably inspired by Titian. Much of Rubens work showcases similar stylistic elements as a number of Titian paintings. He notably would make copies of existing Titian paintings in order to better hone his skills. In addition to studying Titian he studied the works of Michelangelo and Raphael while touring Italy and studying many of the most famous 16th century Italian artists. He is noted for his use of precise line, Contour, and color. Ribbons had an emphasis on naturalism which reflects his intense study of ancient Greek sculpture. While in Italy Rubens worked at the court of mantua under Vincenzo Gonzaga, it is likely here that he was exposed to the original, now lost, Titian painting of Isabella (Goldfarb, Freedberg, & Mena Marqués, 1998). Rubens it was at the court of mantua**

**serving as the court painter to Vincenzo Gonzaga then Duke of mantua from 1600 to 1603. This definitively indicates the choice of depicting Isabella d'Este (Varshavskaia & Egorova, 2013). Furthermore Rubens has been noted for his inability to truly depict women in a beautiful manner akin to that of masters such as botticelli or bronzino. This aligns with his depiction of Isabella as she appears while healthy objectively good looking when compared to other portraits of her her beauty is not as clearly defined in this portrait. Rubens was noted for his depiction of numerous high profile and influential women of his time, as such the selection to re depict Isabella, one of the most notable Italian art patrons of her time, is justified (Lyon, 2018).**

- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - **a. Like the Renaissance artists he studied Rubens was noted for his numerous sketch studies. As such it is highly likely that his other works utilized live models and preliminary sketches. However as previously mentioned this work is a copy of a last Titian painting therefore it would be impossible for Rubens to have used any form of model.**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Zazara (turban-like headdress)**
  - b. **Visible camicia**
  - c. **Wide and low neckline gown**
  - d. **Girdle with a rosary**
  - e. **Baragoni sleeves**
  - f. **Fur trimmed sleeve cuffs**
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?
  - a. **See other portraits of Isabella d'Este under analysis.**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **Is previously mentioned Rubens depiction of Isabella herself may be considered inconsistent with both renaissance and baroque ideas of beauty. However the manner of dress and accessories that Isabella is depicted in showcase a shift in 16th century Italian dress for women. This strikingly low and wide neckline of her gown showcase in highlight her camicia covered breasts and chest in a manner unique to the early 16th century. Similarly the zazara that she wears is indicative of expanding trade routes between Italy in the Middle East in which the headdress design gained its inspiration.**

### *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - **a. The extremely low and wide neckline of her gown stands out to me as this style appears to really be concentrated in the mantua region of Italy during this period. Furthermore the presence of fur trimmed sleeves is a unique**

**insight into the possible time of year in which the original Titian painting was commissioned.**

- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This work highlights aspects about isabella's dress identity that further inform my research question.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - **a. This work speaks to Rubens numerous artistic influences throughout his life. You see the heightened attention to detail in the jewels of her headdress in the presence of some slight folds and please within the camicia. Contrastingly the undefined and hurried brushstrokes of her sleeves and gown and the lack of clear rendering of textiles in light source hint at the baroque influences.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **The depiction of fashion in this work speaks to the importance of dress and dress identity in relation to class and gender within the Italian renaissance. The manner in which Isabella is dressed reveals not only her class and gender but also her connection to the court of mantua.**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - a. **According to the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna The original Titian painting in which this portrait is a copy of depicted Isabella at about age 50. If this is assumed to be true that would place the last Titian painting of Isabella at circa 1524. At this point her husband Francesco had been dead for five years, upon which her eldest son, Federico took up the position of Marquis of Mantua. With this and the knowledge that throughout her marriage to Francesco there was an emphasis on the lives of their children, even the last part of her marriage in which Francesco and her appeared to be at odds, one can assume that this was a period in which Isabella embraced her role as the matriarch. In opposition of other notable widows of the period, Isabella is not depicted in black, Possibly a sign of the equality scene within her marriage to Francesco. As the two Co ruled throughout their marriage and Isabella was given many responsibilities of state it is possible she did not feel that she needed continued to wear the garb of a widow after about five years post francesco's death (Cockram, 2013; James,2012).**

- 20. Are the people in the artwork clothed? If not, are the naked bodies ornamented or fashioned in some way?
  - a. **Lucrezia is clothed in this painting.**
- 21. How are the people oriented (front facing, three-quarter view, profile, or back facing)? Consider what this orientation signifies.
  - a. **Lucrezia is depicted in a 3/4th pose. This orientation could be a composition technique to showcase depth in the painting or align with period portraiture techniques.**

- 25. Describe the main elements of clothing for each person in the image in detail, noting the garment category and how it is worn. Also note whether any outdoor clothing.
  - a. **Lucrezia is wearing a white camicia with embroidery and two buttons at the neck, and pleating at the collar and cuffs. The camicia peaks out of the sleeve of her black gown. The camicia is also greatly visible at the chest. The black gown Lucrezia wears is long sleeved with visible gathers/ pleats at the square neckline. Lucrezia also appears to be wearing some form of over dress or mantle, possibly a mantle. This mantle has gathered/ cuffed sleeves that stop at the elbow, and has a wide deep square neckline.**
- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.

- a. **The textiles can not be definitively identified however, Lucrezia's camicia is likely made of fine linen. The shine visible on the fabric of Lucrezia's gown hints at a textile with lustrous properties, such as a silk taffeta.**
- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?

- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **The dagger can possibly be an indicator of her Borgia roots and the strength and brutality that was associated with Lucrezia Borgia throughout her lifetime. However, the dagger also has connections to the symbolism of virtue (NGV, 2008). The dagger is held close to Lucrezia, possible indicative of this characteristic or virtue being very important to her.**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **While not much of Lucrezia's gown is visible, and her mantle appears unadorned, the complexity of Lucrezia's camicia finishings and the prescenes of cartridge pleats in numerous locations in her dress can suggest a status of wealth and privilege.**
- 32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - a. **Lucrezia wears short cropped hair that falls around her chin. Her hair is parted down the middle of her head and pushed back off her face. Lucrezia's lips are bright red, suggesting that she is wearing red lipstick.**

- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **The work appears to be completed with every element distinguishable.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **This painting fits within High Renaissance portraiture and the humanist and classicist movements. Lucrezia's depiction pays heightened attention to light source, details of dress, body proportionality, and overall emphasis on realism all characteristics of Italian Renaissance art. The inclusion of the piece of paper on the table with visible writing intended for the viewer to read was a technique also seen frequently in Renaissance art, specifically in religious works.**
- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?

- **background is filled with the myrtle bushes. However, there is a further background beyond the myrtle bushes that is visible in the mid right of the portrait. There appears to be a mountain or cliff that then overlooks a blue mountain in the distance. As each object distinctively occupies its own plane, there is little interaction between the spaces, with the exception of Lucrezia's hands hovering into the foreground as they hold the dagger.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **Perspective as slightly been altered to make the myrtle flowers appear more detailed despite their distance from the foreground of the painting. This compositional choice was likely made to further emphasize the symbolic nature of the myrtle flowers in relation to Lucrezia's identity.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **The scale of the artwork is close to human scale. Considering this composition is a half torso depiction of Lucrezia the canvas size would place her around full scale. This furthers the concept of this being a portrait as it represents not only a lifelike depiction of the sitter (assumingly, as this portrait has been compared to a 1502 portrait medal of Lucrezia with both depictions baring several similarities) (NGV, 2008).**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **The oval shape of the canvas creates a very close framing of Lucrezia's body. The oval shape of the canvas also mimics the oval shape of Lucrezia's head shape. The voluminous nature of her mantle takes up a large portion of the lower half of the portrait. The myrtle bushes in the background in combination with the table in the foreground seem to compress the composition around Lucrezia.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - *a.* **The use of color is rather muted in this composition. Lucrezia is dawned in all black, safe for her camicia. The bright white of her camicia draws the viewer's eyes to this garment, which subconsciously draws the viewer's eyes to Lucrezia's face. Similarly, the white cuff of her camicia peeking out of her gown cuff draws the viewer's attention to her hands and the gold dagger clasped within it. The white color of the myrtle flowers on the otherwise darker colored background also draw the eyes' attention. The brown table in the foreground creates a distinct spatial difference from Lucrezia's voluminous black mantle and gown. This color distinction then draws attention to the paper with the corresponding quote that faces the viewer.**

## *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **The artist emphasized Lucrezia's face and camicia, the dagger in her hands, the myrtle flowers and the paper on the table in front of her. All of these**

**elements are in some way indicative of her identity and personal values, and as such emphasized by the artist.** 

- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **The artist emphasized these elements using color and space (see Observation questions #38-40).**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **The underlying structure of the portrait is rounded. Lucrezia's face follows the same shaping of the canvas, as does her body when it is hid underneath her black mantle (in which her shoulders appear slightly rounded). The leaves of the myrtle bush are also oval in shape with points on the end. Finally, the hilt of Lucrezia's dagger is rounded and has round floral petals. As Lucrezia is framed within the painting to take up a majority of the composition and the background is made up of natural elements (i.e., sans any human created pattern, rhythm, or structure).**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **There is not really a sense of balance as the artist has subtly and intentionally destabilized the composition. Lucrezia, in her ¾ pose, leans towards the left of the composition with her body angled to the right, similarly the myrtle bushes appear to have a gap on the right side of the portrait.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The composition does appear to be unified as color is utilized to integrate and connect numerous elements of the composition. The appearance of white in all three spaces (fore, mid, and background) aids in this sense of unity and integrates otherwise distinctive spaces.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **The artist is trying to convey a number of Lucrezia's values not directly related to her feminine appearance (which is the reason her dress/ gown is not very visible under her mantle). This is achieved utilizing discreet symbolism such as the myrtle flowers, and overt symbolism such as the dagger and the quote on paper.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The choice of medium is consistent with period traditions for the creation of portraiture.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The artist utilizes rest in a way that is more consistent with a man, as the manner she is holding the dagger resembles the way a sword or dagger would be held attached to a belt on armor.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **The amount of her garments visible under the black mantle indicate dress elements that would be consistent with her gender, class, and age.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?

- a. **The mantle that Lucrezia is wearing is more akin to one worn during travel or while outdoors, while the visible parts of her gown and camicia are consistent with early/mid 16th century dress. The camicia being exceptionally visible in the neckline of the gown was consistent for the early/mid 16th centuries, the full visibility of the camicie is indicative of a dress style that was popularized closer to the 1520s and 1530s, years after Lucrezia's death (De Young, 2019; Tortora & Marcketti, 2015). However, the style of garments Lucrezia is wearing in this depiction would have been consistent during the last few years of her life.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The wearing of a mantle could have religious reference as throughout the Renaissance saints and other religious figures were consistently depicted in mantles.**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The black mantle, as previously mentioned conceals and hides a large portion of Lucrezia's body, most notably many of her feminine features that would have otherwise been highlighted in Italian Renaissance female portrait conventions (i.e., hair, breasts, waist, stomach/womb).**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **The body appears to be proportional in its representation of the body. However, in this depiction Lucrezia is depicted appearing slightly younger than she would have been at the earliest known date of this portrait (Lucrezia died in 1519 at the age of 39).**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This artwork was examined as it provides insight into the dress identity Lucrezia Borgia conveyed. As the only widely accepted official portrait of Lucrezia Borgia it provides insight into her dress and/or legacy of dress identity.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **I find the abundance of flowers in the portrait inspire happiness or tranquility, a trait not readily attributed to Lucrezia Borgia in most contemporary interpretations of her life.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My personal reaction indicates a shifting understanding or interpretation of Lucrezia Borgia.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **Coming into my research I had prior knowledge of the rumors and historical depiction of Lucrezia Borgia as a possible incestuous black widow who was the only daughter of the powerful and corrupt Borgia Pope.**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?

- a. **This portrait is a single work.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - a. **Dossi was primarily a landscape and religious/ poetic allegory painter. As such any other portraits he has created many have primarily been of men, and those of women differ greatly from this portrait. However, Dossi was noted as having created several oval shaped paintings while at the d'Este court between 1515 and 1520 (NGV, 2008).**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?
  - a. **Dossi was a noted court painter in Ferrara throughout the early 16th century. Humfrey and Lucco (1998) assert that Dossi favored landscape and religious painting over portraiture, as evidenced by the disproportionate amount of his works in landscape or religious allegories, and the abundance of information on this type of work from his studio. Dossi was noted for creating background landscapes of green or yellow glazes which can be "removed by too-thorough cleaning or have faded naturally, allowing the blue substrate to become over dominant," (Humfrey & Lucco, 1998, p. 83). This blue substrate creates the illusion of the blue and green mountain in the background beyond the myrtle bushes on the right side of the composition. Notably in other Dossi works he depicts individuals with a similarly pointed nose as to the one Lucezia is depicted with. It is possible that Lucrezia actually had such a nose shape in real life and that the artist just favored this nose shape in his other non-portrait works. However, several historians have noted that Dossi was inclined to typify physical features in his portraits instead of depicting personal features (Humfrey & Lucco, 1998).**
- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - a. **While not much is known about Dossi's portraiture painting techniques, his landscapes and allegory paintings have been discovered to feature quick organizational sketches on the backs of canvases and underneath the primer. This indicates some forethought and understanding of the human body or use of mannequins of models to create such movement and orientation. However, as noted above Dossi was known to take some liberties with the accuracy in which he portrayed his subjects in his portraits. In this we can conclude that he most likely did not paint the entire portrait with a live model (Humfrey & Lucco, 1998).**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Camicia**
  - b. **Overgown/ mantle**
  - c. **Square neckline**

- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?
  - a. **There have been numerous portraits and paintings by various other artists that have been theorized to be of Lucrezia Borgia, however this painting has been widely accepted by many historians to depict her (NGV, 2008; Hudson, 2013).**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **This portrait distinctly marks a shift in identity for Lucrezia. As a woman whose femineity was utilized throughout her life to benefit her family and offer social and political advantages, she is depicted in this painting without the traditional Renaissance portraiture denotations of womanhood. Instead, she is depicted with symbolisms of femineity and references to Venus (**

*Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **I find this work exceptionally unique for a portrait of such a high profile aristocratic Renaissance woman as it lacks so many of the overt emphasis on her gender. Namely, much of her dress that would truly indicate her feminine nature is purposely hidden beneath a mantle and she wears a hairstyle strikingly dissimilar to those worn by women of her social status during this period.**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This artwork promotes feelings of confusion and intrigue. While many historical accounts and pop culture (i.e the two Borgia centric television shows) have depicted Lucrezia as being the physical embodiment of "womanly wiles" her femineity is distinctly subdued in this portrait. Thus this portrait represents a great opportunity for analysis of Lucrezia's dress identity and overall identity conveyed in this work.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **This work showcases the fact that for whatever reason (Lucrezia's request or Dossi own personal lack of partiality to portraiture) Dossi broke with tradition and depicted Lucrezia in a manner that led to her being mistaken as a man by scholars for centuries.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **As the depiction of fashion in this work is rather lacking and as such atypical for the period, substantive conclusions cannot be made about the fashion in this work being representative of period cultural norms.**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of

beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.

a. **Born in 1480 to Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia and his mistress Vannozza Cattanei, Lucrezia Borgia was only twelve years old when her father became Pope Alexander VI in 1492. Prior to this completion of this portrait Lucrezia had amassed a reputation as a political tool of her fathers to be wielded through marriage alliances. However, this reputation was soured after the sudden enforced divorce (under the grounds that Sforza was impotent) from her first husband Giovanni Sforza following their 1493 marriage, the murder of a suspected lover of Lucrezia's in 1498, her quick marriage to Alfonso d'Aragona the same year and his subsequent early death in 1500, and eventually her last and most successful marriage to Alfonso d'Este (Bradford, 2004). Upon her 1502 marriage to d'Este and arrival in Ferrara she was apparently described to have been wearing transparent and revealing blouse, a stark contrast from the more conservative and unadorned image she conveys in this painting (Hagen & Hagen, 2018). This reputation amongst the aristocracy of the Italian city states and aristocracy partnered with her father's infamous and brutal reputation as pope could signal a desire to detach herself from the black widow persona. In a manner of speaking the adapted quote from Virgil seen on the paper in the composition speaks to this concept of virtue triumphing above all. Lucrezia's namesake Lucretia (and ancient roman heroine) embodied this idea of virtue as she committed suicide supposed to (avenge the dishonor brought upon her by a nobleman. Her sacrifice ultimately leading to the establishment of the Roman Republic," (Villis, n.d.). This knowledge offers further meaning to the dagger Lucrezia possesses within the portrait as this was an extremely rare accessory for a woman to be depicted with in Italian Renaissance portraiture. At the time of this portrait Lucrezia would have been within a year of her death or already dead, been Duchess of Ferrara, and mother to five children (of which four would survive until adulthood). In many ways the typical symbolism conveyed in the dress of aristocratic Renaissance women's portraiture, such as wealth, fertility, and status, were ideals that Lucrezia intrinsically embodied and did not need to emphasize in portraiture. While at this point her father had died during his tenure as Pope and brothers, Cesare and Juan, were both dead left Lucrezia relatively independent (Strathern, 2019). This portrait showcases the identity of a woman that had lived a complex life and had finally accomplished what had been hoped and expected of her, despite the downfall of the Borgia family. Her final connection to her Borgia identity is the use of the repeated symbolism of virtue, associated with Venus who was used in the Borgia family emblem, and frequently associated with Lucrezia during this period (Hudson, 2013; Villis, n.d.).**

- 9. Has this work been altered in some way from its original state?
  - a. **It is unknown if this portrait has been altered in any way. However, there are no apparent outstanding visual alterations.**
- 10. Where is the emphasis in the image?
  - a. **The emphasis is on Margherita's voluminous gown.**
- 11. What captures your attention first?
  - a. **The woman in the background in the green gown captures my eye first.**
- 12. How many persons are included in the artwork?
  - a. **There are five women in this portrait.**
- 13. Are the figures in the artwork known persons? Is the work intended as a portrait? Can they be identified by name? If so, this knowledge of their identity inform your analysis?
  - a. **The woman that is emphasized in the portrait is Margherita Paleologo, and the women in the background are assumed to be women of the court of Mantua. The woman in green is likely a lady-in-waiting or servant of Margherita's, and one of the three women being greeted is a nun. Some scholars believe that Margherita's mother-in-law Isabella d'Este is one of the three women being greeted into the room (Clayton & Whitaker, 2007). Knowledge of the individual's identities can further aid in identifying any dress symbolism in the composition.**

- 14. If there is more than one person, what is their physical position relative to each other? Does their position, posture, or body language echo their relationship?
  - a. **Margherita is displayed in the foreground with her back to the other women. The servant has her head turned towards Margherita while she holds open a curtain to let the other three women are huddled together as they come in through the doorway.**
- 15. Where is their gaze directed?
  - a. **Margherita's eyes are directed at the viewer, while everyone else's eyes appear to be aimed at Margherita.**
- 16. Is the setting indoors or outdoors?
  - a. **The setting is indoors.**
- 17. Does the artwork depict a specific place or setting?
  - a. **The artwork likely depicts the Camerini del Sole and/or delle Cappe, or another residences in the Gonzaga family Ducal Palace (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008).**
- 18. What elements of the setting or background are notable?
  - a. **The doorways are distinct and mimic those in Italian Renaissance architecture in typical palazzos, including the bust positioned above the furthest archway.**
- 19. Does the setting convey status, privilege, or other meaning?
  - a. **The setting conveys a sense of privilege and aristocracy as the room Margherita is sitting in and the room behind her are clearly very large for the period, hinting at her wealth and likely status as an aristocrat.**
- 20. Are the people in the artwork clothed? If not, are the naked bodies ornamented or fashioned in some way?
  - a. **All of the people in the portrait are clothed.**
- 21. How are the people oriented (front facing, three-quarter view, profile, or back facing)? Consider what this orientation signifies.
  - a. **Margherita is facing towards the viewer with a slight ¾ angle. See question #13 and 14 for other individuals in this portrait. Margherita's orientation is consistent with most Italian Renaissance portrait sitting conventions.**
- 22. What is the gender of each person in the image? Has the artist emphasized gender or obscured it?
  - a. **All of the individuals in this portrait are women. Their gender is emphasized through their dress.**
- 23. Consider the posture of the sitter(s). Are they seated, standing, or reclining? Are parts of the body not visible in the image? Is their posture rigid or relaxed? Is posture indicative of state of mind and/or training of the body?
  - a. **Margherita appears to be sitting in a chair (the handle is visible under her right sleeve), which adds to her straight non-slouched posture. Her straight posture, with one hand on her lap and the other on the opposite chair arm indicates both formality and a relaxed posture.**
- 24. Are other objects or animals included in the image to depict activities, interest, or status,…? How does the sitter engage with these objects?
  - a. **There are no other objects in the portrait aside from accessories and her chair that she interacts with. However, her chair and her seemingly**

**comfortable positioning in it suggests that she speeds a fair amount of time sitting down and doing some form of period and status appropriate activity (weaving, writing, reading, etc).** 

- 25. Describe the main elements of clothing for each person in the image in detail, noting the garment category and how it is worn. Also note whether any outdoor clothing.
  - a. **Margherita is wearing a camicia under a what appears to be a two layered gown. The outergown seems to be made of woven together black strips of fabric with gold trim that create chain links described as fantasie dei vinci (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008). Under this gown is brocade gown visible through the black links. The sleeves of the gown are in the large voluminous style popular in Italy during this period.**
- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **The Royal Collection Trust (n.d.) theorizes that the black strips are made of a heavy silk, while the under gown (originally a pale crimson) could be made of any number of high quality fabrics of the period. Her camicia is likely made of a fine linen.**
- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?
  - a. **The camicia is embroidered with red thread at the collar and on the body of the shift, while the undergown appears to be a brocade or have embroidery.**
- 28. Is any element of dress exaggerated?
  - a. **Despite what contemporary viewers may think, there is not any exaggerated element of her dress.**
- 29. Describe the accessories of each person…Note how they are worn, carried, or placed in the image.
  - a. **Margherita is wearing a large turban-like headdress, known as a zazara, of gold strands with a large floral brooch in the center front. She is wearing a set of pearl drop earrings with gold settings, and a long gold chain necklace that is laid twisted near her bust. Margherita is also wearing a gold woven/chain girdle, from which a lapis lazuli rosary hangs and which she uses her left hand to hold up one strand of. She also has a total of three rings: two on her right hand one that appears to showcases gold leaves and a silver stone in the middle sits on her index finger, and the other a simple gold band with a small red jewel sits on her pinky finger; on her left hand is an elaborate gold ornamented band with a circular black stone in the middle which sits on her index finger. In her right hand she grasps a pair of gold colored gloves.**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **As lapis lazuli is and was an incredibly rare and expensive mineral the fact that her entire very long rosary is made of such a material is a key indicator of status.**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **Margherita's extravagant gown and accessories provide the viewer an understanding that this women is of a high socio-economic status. Not only**

**indicated by her jewelry, but by the multi-layered gown and abundance of high quality fabrics used to create it.** 

- 32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - a. **Margherita has her hair parted down the middle in a spiral curl style with a majority of the hair pulled back into the zazara. She does not appear to be wearing any makeup.**
- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **The image appears to be a realistic depiction.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **All elements of the painting appear to be finished and distinguishable.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **The artwork fits within the Italian Renaissance portraiture style that was based on ideas of humanism and classicism. This portrait specifically aligns with the heightened attention to realism in the depiction of the body, dress, and the space/ environment in which the sitter resides in the composition.**
- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **There is a distinct sense of space throughout the composition. Margherita is positioned in the foreground, the doorway closest to the viewer represents the mid-ground and the four women at the second doorway represent the background. The background is multi-layered as the four women are at different depths with the painting (i.e., the servant in green is closer to the mid-ground than the other three women).**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **Perspective does not appear to be altered in an notable way or distorted.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **The work is very close to life sized with the painting being a height of almost 4 feet. Considering that Margherita is sitting down it can easily be concluded that the painting was intended to be life sized or as close to that as possible.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **Margherita's form is situated within the center of the composition, however background elements aid in framing her body within the broader composition. The mid-ground doorway situated on the right side of the composition frames and provides a backdrop for her right side, aiding in giving the illusion that she is positioned off-center. The side of the doorway frame draws a straight line that is parallel to her face. The horizontal line on the floor that denotes two steps up into the background room also acts as a framing tool, as it separates the interactions in the background from Margherita's sitting form in the foreground.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The layered nature of colors on Margherita's gown aids in drawing attention to her, despite the plethora of dark hues present. The under gown**

**Margherita is wearing features white and light red colors that bring a highlight to the gown and Margherita adding balance to her pale light colored face that is bathed in the dark brown background on the left side of the composition and her black woven over gown. The lighter golden brown/red color of her zazara complements her golden brown/red hair and almost blends the two elements together and provide a softness to the colors around her face. The stark green featured in the background provide a distracting highlight that was possibly added to complement Margherita's green colored eyes. This theory is further validated in the fact that Margherita's right eye is angled to the right corner of her eye as if to gesture towards the servant in green.** 

## *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **The artist emphasized the voluminous and complex gown of Margherita. This is meant to signify her wealth and status as the wife of a duke in her ability to wear and own such elaborate dress.**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **The artist emphasized this through the use of color and line as explained in Observation questions #39 and 40.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **There is a distinct rectangular framing structure throughout the composition that adds depth. The canvas itself presents itself as the outermost frame, then the first doorway closest to Margherita in the background represents the second and the final frame is created by the furthest doorway. Each rectangular structure frames its own narrative or movement.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - **a. There is a slight sense of balance in this composition as each space within the composition is equally filled with individuals/movement. This aids in the compositional balance is there is no awkward disproportionate gap in the depth filled composition. The artist could have chosen to have the rooms behind Margherita void of people and just architectural focused, however this absence would have destabilized the composition leaving the viewer a sense of unease at the awkward void of content. Also as previously mentioned the doorway closet to Margherita also frames the background directly behind her, giving the illusion that she is positioned off-center within the composition.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The composition appears very divided in the use of space, as previously outlined sin Observation question #39. The few elements that integrated the numerous spaces, such as the presence of green in the foreground and background, are very passive and subtle.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?

- a. **The artist is trying to express the wealth and status now presented to Margherita as a new member of the Gonzaga ducal family. This is achieved visually in the complex depiction of her over gown, zazara, and the presence of a servant, greeting party, and large chambers in the background of the composition.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The medium adds consistency with the period conventions for portraiture.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The manner in which Margherita sits within the chair (back straight, arms on the chair sides, head held high despite her zazara) and her lack of evident activity/ work (such as in other Renaissance paintings depicting women of lower socio-economic classes) indicates her leisurely lifestyle, a type of lifestyle that during this period was reserved for the wealthy and aristocratic women.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **The dress Margherita is depicted wearing is consistent with her gender, age, class, and (lack of) occupation.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **This style of dress is considered consistent with this time period and this region of Italy.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The wearing of a zazara is significant as this head accessory was popular in Mantua (Gonzaga territory) during this period. The head accessory was thought to have been popularized by Margherita's mother-in-law Isabella d'Este (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008).**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The voluminous nature of Margherita's gown disguises much of her body below the bust. However, in hiding her body the gown also creates the illusion that she is taking up more space, a significant characteristic of the dress of a new duchess who would aim for her presences in a room to be large and notable.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **The artist does not appear to have taken any liberties in the depiction of the sitter. Her body appears to be proportionate, and not distorted in any notable way.**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **The inspiration for analyzing this work was the very clear dress identity Margherita, as a new member of court, was aiming to convey in complying with a number of Mantua dress conventions.**

- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **This painting in a way makes me a little sad. The number of dark colors that surround Margherita and the way she is distanced from the other women in the portrait makes me imagine she is lonely in some way.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My reactions indicate a difference in class beliefs. During this period as a duchess even Margherita's closest friends at court would be distanced from her in terms of class as they would not socially be considered her equal. As such, what I perceive as loneliness could simply be a visual representation of her social superiority to those around her.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I can not identify a personal connection or bias to this work.**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **This painting is thought to be part of a two part series, with the other portrait depicted her husband Federico (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008).**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - **a. Romano concentrated on biblical and allegorical landscapes in much of his work. However, notably there was a 1518** *Portrait de Dona Isabel de Requesens, vice-reine de Naples, dit longtemps Portrait de Jeanne D'Aragon* **, in the Musée du Louvre, he created that features some similarities to his portrait of Margherita. The painting was created by Romano and his master Raffaello Santi (otherwise known as Raphael). The painting features a woman wearing a zazara and similarly voluminous sleeves. What is striking in terms of similarities between he two paintings is the sense of depth created by the background architecture. The care and detail in creating a realistic multi-layered background speaks to the artist's special emphasis on realism throughout the composition.**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?
  - a. **Romano spent a large portion of his earlier career studying and working with Raphael. Notably, he aided Raphael in his work for Pope Leo X, in Papal Loggie (known as the Stanze). Vasari (1550-1568/1912-1915) noted that from his work with Raphael he learned how to actually depict architecture in his paintings to scale using perspective. This is exceptionally clear in this painting with Romano's diligence in depicting Margherita's rooms in the background. In 1524, Romano was brought to Mantua under the invitation of Federico Gonzaga to decorate and design rooms in the Palazzo del Tè (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008; Vasari, 1550-1568/1912-1915). Further similarities in Romano's style is present in the way he utilizes color. A number of Romano's works, such as the** *Portrait of Jeanne D'Aragon* **, and**

**this portrait feature the color black prominently (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008).** 

- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - a. **Romano was noted for utilizing sketches when developing his art. However, a majority of the works he created were biblical or allegorical scenes, which were not aiming to realistic capture a physical person's representation (Vasari, 1550-1568/1912-1915). As such one can conclude that Romano utilized sketching and Margherita as a life model to create this work.**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Zazara**
  - b. **Overgown**
  - c. **Undergown**
  - d. **Camicia**
  - e.
- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?
  - a. **Isabella d'Este was largely considered a fashion icon at the court of Mantua at the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century. Her popularization of the zazara and the voluminous sleeves as seen on Margherita. This style of dress is seen in numerous portraits of Isabella d'Este and other Mantua women from the early-mid 16th century. A medal from 1561 created by Pastorino de' Pastorini is referenced to confirm Margherita's likeness as it is the only confirmed depiction of her, however this portrait is generally considered to depict Margherita (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008)**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **The dress evident in this portrait hint at the evolution of what garments or accessories were considered fashionable and enhanced a woman's beauty. The addition of the zazara aided in creating the illusion of the higher forehead which had been considered fashionable in Italy since the mid-15th century. The almost complete exposure of the upper half of the camicia at the neckline of the gown speaks to more loosened standards of propriety, such as allowing women to showcase more of their undergarments. This 16th century trend is showcased so much so in this depiction of Margherita that her entire camicia is embroidered, and not just the collar. Thus proving that this undergarment previously having only the collar visible, was now acceptable, and even considered a complementing element of women's dress.**

## *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **The amount of dark colors present in the foreground of the composition, with so many lighter hues present in the mid-ground and background. I**

**wonder what the purpose was for this, as Margherita is arguably the intended focus of this portrait.**

- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This artwork aids in providing data and information to the focus and research question attached to this project. Specifically, this work provides insight into specific dress traditions adopted by non-natives in particular regions of Italy such as Mantua.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **This work highlights humanist traditions in art during the period in the heightened attention to detail in the depiction of Margherita and her dress. Furthermore, the inclusion of numerous architectural elements in the background of the portrait was consistent with Italian Renaissance art. Romano creates a realistic space in which a portrait depicts possibly the everyday or mundane activity of such a high status woman.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **The dress that Margherita is depicted in speaks to a shift towards Northern European dress influence in terms of voluminous garments paired with Italian textile traditions. Additionally, the adoption of the zazara highlights the influence that trade with the Middle East placed on dress during this period.**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - **a. In 1531, Margherita Paleologo, daughter of the Marquis of Monferrato, married into the Gonzaga ducal family upon her marriage to Federico Gonzaga, the 5th Marchese and subsequent 1st Duke of Mantua. Upon her marriage she would have entered the newly established ducal court in Mantua at the age of 21, and likely would have been under the influence of the widowed Isabella d'Este-Gonzaga. Isabella was renowned throughout Italy for her patronage and style, as such it would be logical for the new duchess to adopt the revered dress style of her mother-in-law. The wearing of a zazara and fantasie dei vinci showcase the manner in which Margherita abandoned the dress traditions of her home (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008). The lapis lazuli rosary that Margherita holds further showcases her new alignment with Gonzaga family. Mentioned in a 1531 letter, Federico sent his bride a similar necklace which Margherita was said to have styled with a zazara (Clayton & Whitaker, 2008). While the painting otherwise lacks overt symbolism to the Gonzaga family aside from the adaptation of her motherin-law's signature style, knowledge of the possible origins of her rosary indicates intentionality in its inclusion in this painting. Margherita wearing and holding the rosary in her hands speaks to a possible tangible desire for**

**her husband. While not overly bedecked in jewels as other new brides were in period portraiture, Margherita conveys her allegiance as a new Gonzaga wife and the first Duchess of Mantua in her Mantuian dress and the presence of the Gonzaga associated lapis lazuli rosary.**

- 16. Is the setting indoors or outdoors?

- a. **The setting is indoors and appears to be in a studio like setting as the background is a green curtain.**
- 17. Does the artwork depict a specific place or setting?
  - a. **A green curtain studio like setting that mimics another Bronzino portrait with a similar background (***Lady with Her Little Boy***, c. 1540-45, National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC) (Gáldy & Bronzino, 2013).**
- 18. What elements of the setting or background are notable?
  - a. **The background is a plain green draped fabric, as such there is nothing notable about it.**
- 19. Does the setting convey status, privilege, or other meaning?
  - a. **The fact that the two individuals were painted in a seated portrait style that appears to be in a studio setting hints at their wealth and privilege. Furthermore, the green cloth background is textured in a way that could possibly allude to it being velvet, a luxury fabric during the time.**
- 20. Are the people in the artwork clothed? If not, are the naked bodies ornamented or fashioned in some way?
  - a. **Both of the people were clothed in the portrait.**
- 21. How are the people oriented (front facing, three-quarter view, profile, or back facing)? Consider what this orientation signifies.

- 23. Consider the posture of the sitter(s). Are they seated, standing, or reclining? Are parts of the body not visible in the image? Is their posture rigid or relaxed? Is posture indicative of state of mind and/or training of the body?
  - a. **Francesco is standing, while his mother Eleonora is seated. Eleonora is seated in a stiff position that can be attributed to her alla Spagnola style of dress which includes a stiff bodice. Her hand over her stomach/waist can also be indicative of her fertility. Eleonora's hand gestures towards her son, and her son's hand points inward to himself, possibly drawing attention to the connection between mother and son and the fact that Eleonora produced a healthy male heir.**
- 24. Are other objects or animals included in the image to depict activities, interest, or status,…? How does the sitter engage with these objects?
  - a. **Eleonora is holding a handkerchief in her right hand, but otherwise does not engage with any other object in the painting.**

  - a. **Eleonora's gown is textured in a way that is similar to the green background, which could imply that it is velvet. The manner in which Bronzino depicts the light hitting the fabric is consistent with period depictions of velvet. The sleeves on her zimarra also indicate slashing, a typically Italian sleeve embellishment, which hints at her spanglo-italian style**
- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?
  - a. **Her zimarra is trimmed in gold braid as is her gown, and she wears pearl necklaces, a pearl and gold net partlet, and a gold and pearl snood. The camicia underneath her gown and zimarra has the sleeve cuff peaking out, with a hint at geometric blackwork on it (indicative from her Spanish heritage, as it was believed Catherine of Aragon popularized the trend, having brought it to northern Europe upon her marriage to King Henry VII).**
- 28. Is any element of dress exaggerated?
  - a. **Her bodice front looks a bit too long to be realistic or comfortable**
- 29. Describe the accessories of each person…Note how they are worn, carried, or placed in the image.
  - a. **Eleonora wears a gold chain belt (known as a girdle) that hangs in her lap, possibly a hint at the strength of her fertility/womb. She also holds a handkerchief in her hand (reason unknown). She also has a seemingly gold string knotted around her neck, could possibly be a closer for the partlet.**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **The abundance of pearls hints at wealth**
- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **Her spanish-italian style is indicative of her status and the garments she wears indicate a life of leisure**

36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?

- a. **The positioning of Eleonora and her son and the green backdrop create planes of foreground, midground, and background.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **The perspective does not apper to be altered or distorted.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?

- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The portrait features numerous colors but the regal and Catholic colors of red and gold are most noted and prominent.**

## *Reflection*

- 2. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **The faces and bodies of the subjects, the level of gold embroidery on their garments, signaling wealth and status**
- 3. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **Color and line, and slight chiaroscuro (the Renaissance technique of dark and light contrasts). Bronzino further highlights Eleonora's status through her dress. Not only through color, but the sheer volume of her gown and the details, and embroidery lend to the idea that she is a wealthy aristocratic woman.**
- 4. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **The lines in the background draw the eyes towards the two figures. The swirls and embroidery of Eleonora's gown and zimarra add more femininity while her son's garments feature more straight lines, a possible contrast to showcase masculinity.**
- 5. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **There is a slight sense of unbalance, as Eleonora is seated in the middle of the portrait while her son is off to the left. This is could be hinting at period sentiments towards the importance of children or the fact that the true subject of the painting is Eleonora and not both of them.**
- 6. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **There is unity in the painting as the colors of their garments complement each other. Both of their faces are bathed in light furthering minor chiaroscuro effects.**
- 7. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?

- a. **He tries to convey an accurate depiction of a royal elegant woman and her son. He conveys this through the elaborate dress**
- 8. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
- 9. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The seated position and the looks of Eleonora tell the viewer that she is regal, reserved and her expression and pose are indicative of period sentiments of aristocratic women.**
- 10. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **At the time of this painting (c. 1545) Eleonora would have been about 23 years old, and had married Cosimo in 1539 (age 17), meaning she had already adjusted to Florentine court by this time, as apparent in her blended apparel with elements of Spanish and Italian style (Cox-Rearick, 2013)**
- 11. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The garments in this painting are stylistically consistent with the period. Eleonora's dress is a cross between Italian and Spanish styles of this period (as outlined below).**
- 12. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The presence of red/ burgundy can have religious implications as Eleonora was a Spanish Catholic.**
- 13. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The voluminous nature of her zimarra hides almost every aspect of her body, possibly hinting at a piousness that Italian/Florentine styles did not have as they were more revealing.**
- 14. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **Eleonora's fingers seem a bit too long to be proportionate**
- 15. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This painting depicts Eleonora in typically Spanish elements of dress with her son and heir dressed in Italian styles of the time.**
- 16. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **This painting presents curious feelings as Eleonora is depicted in more Spanish than Italian dress as compared to her more famous portraits by Bronzino.**
- 17. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **I do not have any personal reactions to this painting.**
- 18. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I do not have any personal bias in relation to this painting.**
- 19. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **Single artwork, but one of many portraits created by court painter Bronzino**

- 20. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - a. **All of Bronzino's portraits**
    - i. **Bronzino 1575-1599: Similar to this portrait Eleonora is depicted in more traditionally Spanish, and hints to her consistent Spanish influenced style.**
    - **ii. Bronzino 1545-1546: Bronzino depicts Eleonora is a similar posture to that in this portrait, a hint at the continued appearance and emphasis on her ability to produce healthy heirs and her own regalness.**
- 21. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?

- 23. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Partlet (Bavero-collar)**
  - b. **16th century Spanish-Italian Dress**
  - c. **Slashed sleeves**
  - d. **Zimarra**
  - e. **Snood**
- 24. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?

## a. **Yes, see other portraits under analysis.**

- 25. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
- 26. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **This portrait depicts a more conservative dress styling emerging in Europe and Italy. The lack of sleeve slashings, the high collar, the partlet all allude to a shift away from previous Italian Renaissance dress trends as this painting was created as styles in Italy began to reflect Northern European trends that were more consistent with those popular during the early 17th century.**

## *Interpretation*

- 2. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **The overwhelming presence of Spanish influences in Eleonora's depiction and the subtle references to her fertility and accomplishment as an aristocratic/ royal wife.**
- 3. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This painting does to bring about any strong emotive reactions.**

- 4. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **This work upholds many Renaissance painting traditions. Chiefly the depiction of mother and heir, as it is seen as a type of "brag" that this woman has accomplished this societal expectation and her produced heir is healthy. Furthermore, the artist utilizes chiaroscuro in the depictions of their faces, and other mannerist depiction techniques that realistically capture the likeness of Eleonora and her son.**
- 5. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period? a. **See #25**
- 6. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - **a. Eleonora was born in 1522, meaning that she was 23 at the time of this portrait. By this time she was married and had a male heir outside of infancy, meaning in the eyes of period expectations she had fulfilled her purpose in the Medici dynasty. The geometric design on the trim of her zimarra is on contrast with Italian textiles of the period that feature florals, furthering Eleonora's long running notoriety of maintaining elements of her Spanish dress while living her life at the Medici court in Florence. Numerous accounts highlight the fact that her choice to remain in Spanish dress while adopting elements of Italian/Florentine style, in lieu of completely adopting Italian fashions garnered her many Florentine critics. This styling of Eleonora in this portrait with her Medici son is a combination of her numerous identities, her Spanish heritage, her Neapolitan upbringing, and her Florentine marriage. Her instances to remain in alla Spagnola, while perceived as stuborn and disloyal to her husband's home, was in actuality a decree of power and allegiance to the Spanish court for the new Florentine Dukedom ruled by the Medici (Cox-Rearick, 2013). Furthermore, Eleonora was noted for favoring more simplistic textiles for her gowns (evidenced here) despite having access to the most elaborate and intricate textiles in Europe. Thus meaning while she dressed alla Spagnola, her dress was still considered "accessible" in a way that she as a duchess was not. This distinction between a typical foreign dresser and that of a duchess was made in her jewelry. The abundance of her favored pearls and the diamonds on her chain girdle that denote her as a Medici (San Holian, 2008). In essence, this painting of Eleonora says "I am of royal Spanish blood and this is my son, of royal Spanish and Florentine blood. I am the one bringing legitimacy to this family," In this way she is similar to her husband's forefather Cosimo the Elder who married Contessina di Bardi a woman of aristocratic blood to bring legitimacy to the growing Medici empire at the time.**

  - a. **The positioning is in a triangular dynamic position with Eleonora at the tip of the triangle and Giovanni at the bottom left corner. Eleonora has her right**

**arm wrapped around her son in a maternal manner, with Giovanni placing his left hand on his mother's knee. Their bodies are close and touching.**

- 15. Where is their gaze directed?
  - a. **Both the individuals have their gaze directed at the viewer/ painter.**
- 16. Is the setting indoors or outdoors?
  - a. **The portrait seems to have been painted with the two figures on a balcony with the Italian countryside in the background (only visible in the Haltadefinizione digital image)**
- 17. Does the artwork depict a specific place or setting?

- 21. How are the people oriented (front facing, three-quarter view, profile, or back facing)? Consider what this orientation signifies.
  - a. **Eleonora is in a slight ¾ pose, while Giovanni is positioned facing the viewer. Eleonora's positioning could be indicative to create a maternal emphasis as she is partially oriented towards her son, and the viewer.**
- 22. What is the gender of each person in the image? Has the artist emphasized gender or obscured it?
  - a. **Eleonora's femineity is emphasized in this painting via her maternal positioning towards her son. Furthermore, how she is styled and the pomegranate motifs on her gown promote her feminine and maternal nature.**
- 23. Consider the posture of the sitter(s). Are they seated, standing, or reclining? Are parts of the body not visible in the image? Is their posture rigid or relaxed? Is posture indicative of state of mind and/or training of the body?
  - a. **Eleonora appears to be sitting with Giovanni appearing to be standing and leaning against his mother. The mother son interaction is relatively formal, with Eleonora sitting in a rather rigid position, which can be attributed to her Spanish style rigid bodice. Her legs appear to be together. Her hand is resting at the side of her left leg.**
- 24. Are other objects or animals included in the image to depict activities, interest, or status,…? How does the sitter engage with these objects?
  - a. **There are no objects or animals in the portrait that depict specific activites aside from sitting for this portrait (a plush stool/ bench in the lower right hand corner).**

- 25. Describe the main elements of clothing for each person in the image in detail, noting the garment category and how it is worn. Also note whether any outdoor clothing.
  - a. **Eleonora is wearing a brocade gown with slashed sleeves, a camicia is worn underneath the gown and visible through slashing and at the gown cuffs. Eleonora is not depicted wearing any form of outdoor clothing (this in conjunction to the greenery in the background could hint at the portrait depicting a warmer season). Giovanni's garments are mostly concealed behind the volume of his mother's dress however his gold thread embroidered collar and purple ensemble (unclear if he wears a form of swaddling gown or trousers) automatically speak to his regalness despite his young age (purple was an uncommon color during the Renaissance and frequently reserved for the wealthy).**
- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **The brocade gown appears to be made with black voided velvet and a possible silk organza base. The artist also conveys the gold threads and rope trim. Bronzino is famous for his intricate depictions of textiles, and when depicting a family such as the Medici (whom sought out the finest textiles in Europe and Italy) being able to identify their unattainably expensive textiles was important.**
- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?

  - a. **There does not appear to be any element of dress exaggerated (Bronzino was known for his realism).**
- 29. Describe the accessories of each person…Note how they are worn, carried, or placed in the image.
  - a. **A gold crusted chain linked belt/girdle (jewels every few chain lengths [diamonds, rubies, emeralds?], and pearl strands gathered at the end of the belt to hang), a rigid alla Spagnola bodice, a snood head piece, two pearl necklaces (one with jewel), the snood is gold net with pearls. The diamond necklace is worn in a very prominent place on her neck attached to a strand of pearls, the symbolism within this is that the diamond (statement jewel of the Medici) and the pearls (a symbol of beauty, piety, and virtue) speak to Eleonora's membership to the family and her contributions (San Holian, 2008). Furthermore, the numerous placements of pearls on her garments and accessories hints at not only her personal preference but to the need o communicate the previously mentioned characteristics attached to wearing pearls.**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?
  - a. **The large square diamond necklace is a very clear visual signifier of rank and status as the Medici were noted for presenting their wives in the more**

**regal and expensive diamonds possible. Cosimo ensured that all the women in his family wore diamonds or rubies as a symbol of the Medici dukedom (San Holian, 2008).** 

- 31. Does the clothing serve as an occupational uniform or marker of identity?
  - a. **The gown Eleonora wears speaks for itself as a sign of her membership to the aristocracy. The complex brocade void velvet was not easily accessible to lower social classes, let alone one as complex as this one.**
- 32. Describe the hairstyle and makeup of each person.
  - a. **Eleonora does not appear to be wearing any makeup, she is wearing her hair tucked back into a gold braid snood embellished with pearls.**
- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **This painting is highly realistic.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **The painting is very clear and visible (specifically when viewing the Haltadefinzione version).**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **The portrait does fit with artistic styles of the period. It is very consistent with period concepts of naturalism and realism (Humanism). Bronzino was lauded by his artistic contemporaries for his attention to detail and ability to capture the likeness of his portrait sitters. Italian Renaissance paintings were famous for their realism and their depiction of dress in an accurate manner for the first time in history, this painting is no different.**
- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **This painting does create a foreground (the end of the tassel on Eleonora's girdle, the edge of her dress), mid-ground (Giovanni and Eleonora, and the stool), and background (the Italian countryside). The background is set apart from the fore and mid ground via the balcony railing, however the flow of Eleonora's dress crosses the plane between fore and mid ground connecting the two.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **The perspective does not appear to be distorted.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **As the painting is about 4 feet by 3 feet I would estimate this to be near half scale (of the human body). This could give the viewer a small idea of how large Eleonora's dress would have been in life as it already takes up much of the space in the painting.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - a. **The horizon line and the line of the balcony are parallel creating distinct spaces that aid in framing the space occupied by Eleonora and Giovanni. The line of her skirt alongside Giovanni creates a visual separation between herself and the child. Almost as if to separate her two personas: motherhood**

**and ruler. The lines of her dress furthermore appear to extend so far that they essentially spill off the canvas.** 

- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The use of color on Giovanni's ensemble enables him to complement the color of the sky in the background, further drawing attention to Eleonora in her elaborate gown. The gold brocade and white/silver of her gown are a brightness that complement her pale face in a subtle attempt at chiaroscuro.**

## *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - b. **The artist emphasized the gown Eleonora wore, this is a testament to her wealth and status during the period and possibly a nod to Italian craftsmen**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **The artist draws focus to the gown using color and depicts the elaborate details of the gown. The gown features a large gold motif in the center of the bodice that comes to a point in the center that points up to Eleonora's face. The lines that make up the edges of the gown run off the canvas in one direction and in the other form towards the motif. In essence the lines and colors within the portrait point back towards Eleonora's gown and face. The dress, while it has a large skirt takes up much of the lower half of the portrait.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **The painting utilizes the triangular composition with Eleonora's head at the top point and Giovanni at the bottom left point.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **There is a sense of balance.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The painting is very unified, however the two figures featured in the portrait have distinct spaces and focal points within the painting.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **The artist is defiantly trying to showcase the regal nature of Eleonora's rule, which includes her ability to produce a male heir (Giovanni). Furthermore the artist demonstrates the blend of Eleonora's Spanish heritage with her duty to Italian ways of dressing.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **No**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **The manner in which Eleonora is sitting can be defined as a regal position as she sits sans any domestic work activities. Her calm nature and maternal hands around her son show an inclination to her period appropriate maternal responsibilities.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?

- a. **The dress of Eleonora is consistent with her age, gender, and class/occupation.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The garments that Eleonora is depicted in are consistent with this period and region. The presence of sleeve slashing, the subtle v waistline shape inspired by Spanish influences, the slightly visible camicia at the neckline, and the snood in her hair are all indicative of dress practices of a woman of her status and wealth in Florence at the time.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The textiles of Eleonora's gown feature a motif of pomegranates, furthermore the diamonds Eleonora is wearing are symbolic of the Medici dynasty (Sale Holian, 2008).**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The bodice draws attention to Eleonora's mid-section and by extent her feminine organs. However, the skirt of the dress conceals the rest of her body drawing further attention to her waist. Much of her arms are concealed with the puffy slashed sleeves.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **Eleonora's fingers are a little elongated, possibly a hint at northern European concepts of long thin fingers being considered beautiful.**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This work was examined in an effort to identify Eleonora's dress identity in portraiture throughout different periods of her life.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?

## *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **Eleonora is wearing more Italian inspired garments than Spanish in this depiction. This could be a nod to her more solidified position within the Medici monarchy, and thus Eleonora's own personal choice to wear more Italian styles.**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This work connects directly to my research question in which I identify the dress identity in portraiture of high status aristocratic Italian Renaissance women.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **This artwork is a great example of the virtuoso and humanist traditions of Italian Renaissance artwork. There is a heightened attention and conveying of textiles.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **The depiction showcases that fashion and dress, especially for Italian Renaissance women's dress.**

- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - **a. Eleonora would have been 23 years old during the start of Bronzino's painting of this portrait, and 6 years into her marriage to Cosimo I Duke of Tuscany. Having now provided two male heirs and possibly being pregnant with her third son (Pietro, born 1546) at the time of this commission her status throughout Europe as a beautiful, intelligent, and competent duchess for her husband would be known through this portrait. The idea that she was likely pregnant at the time of this commission makes the pomegranate motif, a notable symbol of fertility of the time, that much more poignant of an inclusion in this portrait. Every aspect of this portrait hints at intersectional identity. The diamonds she wears identify her visually as part of the Medici dynasty, while the pearls (said to have been a personal preference) ("Pearls are a ubiquitous component of every sixteenth-century female aristocrat's dress," [San Holian, 2008, p. 157]) were symbolic of beauty as well as chastity and purity during the Renaissance (San Holian, 2008). These attributes would have been very important for Eleonora to convey as she was a devote Spanish-Italian Catholic of royal blood. The elaborateness of this gown shines opposite from many of Eleonora's personal stylistic tastes (especially this early in her marriage) as at the time she still incorporated many Spanish style garments such as the zimarra into her wardrobe (Cox-Rearick, 2013). However, as this is one of the earliest portraits of Eleonora by Bronzino and certainly the most prominent, in essences serving as a decree of the strength of the Medici lineage and fertility from its new duchess, it is easy to understand why Eleonora has dawned distinctly Florentine and Italian stylings. From the voided velvet brocade gown, to the Italian Renaissance baragoni sleeves, and famous Italian sleeve slashing. Every aspect screams wealth and Italian, and more importantly the wealth and power of the Medici family. The large gem stones that decorate her neck (diamond) and her girdle (diamond, ruby, emerald?), call to the Medici preclivaty towards expensive jewels (San Holian, 2008).**

- 26. Can the type of textiles be determined? Does the artist attempt to convey the nature of the textile,…? Note the colors and dominant patterns in the textiles used for the clothing.
  - a. **The gold embellishments and braiding are very apparent on the black grounded background, two colors that are indicative of her Spanish aristocratic heritage. The lace partlet across her declloge. Bronzino pays particular detail to the embellishments of her gown with the lace.**
- 27. Is the clothing embellished in any way with fur, lace, jewels, embroidery, braid, or beading?
  - a. **The jewels also appear to be some sort of reflective stone as the light source catches every stone/jewel. The pearl necklace as well catches the light in a manner that emphasized its purity and shine. Eleonora's partlet is made of bobbin lace.**
- 28. Is any element of dress exaggerated?

- a. **No element of dress is exaggerated in this painting.**
- 29. Describe the accessories of each person…Note how they are worn, carried, or placed in the image.

- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **This painting is intended to be realistic.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **There are no elements of the work that appear unfinished or indistinguishable.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **The painting fits into the Florentine masters Italian Renaissance paintings and Mannerism. Bronzino accurately captures every element of detail in Eleonora's garments and accessories, while depicting her face in a soft and poetic manner which mixes realism with Mannerist concepts of beauty and poeticism. Furthermore, Bronizino's consistent portrayal of light source, even in the reflection of the diamonds that adorn her outergown is consistent with High Renaissance art. Most strikingly what identifies this work's membership to the late Renaissance is the manner in which Bronzino renders the sheerness of her partlet.**
- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **There is no clear sense of foreground, background, or midground. The solid colored space behind Eleonora's head most clearly marks a background, while the rest of the space within the composition is undefined and can be assumed to be a combination of the midground and foreground.**
- 37. Has perspective been distorted or altered for specific effect?
  - a. **Perspective does not appear to be altered or distorted within this work.**
- 38. What is the scale of the artwork relative to the human body and does this create the illusion of space or evoke a feeling or affect?
  - a. **This painting is very small, and not near life size in any way. The small size in a way diminishes the impact of Eleonora's appearance and status.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.

- a. **Eleonora is framed in the painting in a way that portions of her arms are cut off and her body is cut off just below her bust. This helps the viewer's eye to first see her face and then follow the lines of the pearl necklace which in combination with the v-shape in the middle of her bodice creates a triangular shape that points down the gown while also opening up to her white collar, partlet, and face at the base of the triangle.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The light color of Eleonora's face, lace collar, and pearls really draws the viewers eyes to these areas. While her gold embellished garments highlight the gold in her hair net and connect these colors. The gold also makes her body stand out further against the dark background, utilizing the Renaissance technique of chiaroscuro. The scattered placement of the circular jewels that reflect the light on Eleonora's gown aids in adding a lightness that balances the otherwise darkly hued outergown.**

## *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - a. **The emphasis is on her face and the gold embellishment. This signifies her aristocratic status.**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **The artist highlights this using color and the complex lines of the gold embellishment and other expensive garment detailing. See Observation question #39 and #40.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?
  - a. **There is no structural composition evident besides the centering of Eleonora in the painting.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **The balance is created by the framing of Eleonora in the painting/portrait. She is in centered in the portrait creating a sense of symmetry. Balance is further created through Bronzino's use of color. See Observation question #40.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The portrait seems unified as all of the elements are similar in color, shape, and form.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **Bronzino aims to showcase the aristocratic and regal nature of Eleonora's status. The presence of numerous jewels, including embedded within her garments (the outer gown features what is likely some form of circular diamond), along with the overall wealthy appearance of her dress aids in conveying this identity. Bronzino's heightened use of the color gold further reflects this regal identity as it has numerous associations with wealth and royalty.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?

- a. **The choice of medium does not impact the work in a material way.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?

## a. **The rigid position and lack of smile indicates Eleonora's class and status.**

- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **The dress of Eleonora in this painting is consistent with her gender, age, and class/occupation as she wears a spanglo-italian style of gown which was popular in northern Italian courts at the time, in addition to her adornment of numerous expensive jewels and brocade fabrics which fit her class and age.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The garments Eleonora is depicted in are consistent with the time period in the region.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The visible garments in which Eleonora is depicted showcase iconic Spanish influence on Northern Italian dress during the period. The black and gold colors are consistent with Spanish royal dress conventions. Additionally, the overgown (likely a zimarra) is iconic Spanish garment that gathered popularity in Italy in part due to Eleonora's wearing of it.**
- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The garments Eleonora wears in this portrait primarily conceal her body, with the exception of the lace partlet which tastefully reveals her upper chest in a modest fashion. However, the way that the partlet even covers her neck with its high collar and the thick layered nature of her over and under gowns indicate a modesty that was likely influenced by Eleonora's religious nature and sense of royal propriety.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **Her face appears to be slightly elongated, with a long narrow nose, lips the same size as her eyes and a large square forehead.**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This work was examined to gather an understanding of Eleonora's conveyed dress identity in portraiture and the connections this might have to other aspects of her public facing identity throughout her life.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **I find Eleonora's gown to be very intricate and well crafted, but the excessive emphasis on it makes the depiction come off slightly gaudy, and more aligned with Baroque artistic sensibilities.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My personal reaction more indicates a shift in artistic styles over time, that were overall influenced by culture.**

- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I cannot identify a personal connection with this work.**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **It is not a part of a series.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - a. **Yes, Bronzino created several other portraits of Eleonora over the course of her life. Including a portrait from the late 16th century, and one from 1545- 1546 featuring her first born son and Medici heir, Giovanni. See other portrait analysis.**
- 20. Are there any exhibition catalogues or biographies of the artist? Using these sources, as well as artist statements, diaries, or published reviews from the time period (if available), consider whether or not this work is consistent with the artist's oeuvre. Is there something notable or exceptional about this work?
  - **a. Bronzino is noted for his apt blending of the Italo-Hispanic artistic stylings at the court of Duke Cosimo Iand Eleonora di Toledo. Portraits of this period of women frequently convey a "dynastic message" (p. 37), in which the women are painted as the perfect aristocratic bride. Eleonora in many portraits is seen as the ideal "dynastic bride, the mother of many male children, a lady of proud Spanish lineage, even as some kind ofterrestrial Virgin Mary," (p. 37). The portraits painted of Eleonora later in her life by Bronzino do not showcase her illness. A select few portraits show her progressively getting more ill. Bronzino's Medici portraits are noted for their similarities to photographs. Some of Bronzino's portraits such as the "Eleonora of Toledo and Her Son Francesco" at Museo Nazionale di Palazzo Reale, Pisa from 1549-50, are noted for straying from Bronzino's typical level ofdetail, hinting at a workshop composition. As this work is notably different from his earlier works this could possibly be the case or can be attributed to Bronzino's advanced age. Bronzino is noted for his depiction of geometric lace, such as the partlet and collars. Stylistically Bronzino is also noted for his portraits having clear left originating light sources. Bronzino paints his sheer textiles over opaque objects to get the truly sheer effect. Pays high attention to the depiction of expensive textiles. Bronzino is noted for his upper torso and head focused portraits (Gáldy & Bronzino, 2013).**
- 21. Is it known whether or not the artist worked with artist's mannequins, live models, and/or owned or hired costumes?
  - a. **Bronzino must have worked with previous depictions of her likeness as she died in 1562, 13 years prior to the earliest date of this painting.**
- 22. Identify possible search terms for the dress in the artwork. Are there any unique terms related to the dress that may help refine the search parameters?
  - a. **Partlet (Bavero -collar in Italian)**
  - b. **16th century Spanish-Italian Dress**
  - c. **Slashed sleeves**
  - d. **Snood (hairnet)**
  - e. **Zimarra (full length open coat)\*possibly\***

- 23. Can you locate images depicting the same person or similar garments in other visual media?
  - a. **There are other portraits of Eleonora with her dressed more in the Florentine style, with Florentine neckline (wide boxy).**
- 24. Identify any related or similar garments from dress history texts.
  - a. **See #22**
- 25. Does this work reflect a specific event from history or mark a `notable shift in attitudes about gender, beauty, or identity?
  - a. **This portrait depicts a more conservative dress styling emerging in Europe and Italy. The lack of sleeve slashings, the high collar, the partlet all allude to a shift away from previous Italian Renaissance dress trends as this painting was created on the cusp of the 17th century.**

## *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - a. **The heavy presence of Spanish influences in Eleonora's appearance despite the painting being created after her death. The dark color of her outergown and undergown could be tied to this fact.**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This work aligns with this project's overall research question to investigate the dress identity of these women throughout their lives and how this ties to their public facing identities.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **This work speaks to slight changes and shifts from Late Renaissance art into the Baroque period. While this work bares similarities with earlier Bronzino works, overall it indicates a stylistic change, likely reflective of changing traditions and conventions in art.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period? a. **See question #25**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - **a. Eleonora was born in 1522 and died in 1562, meaning she had been dead at least 13 years at the start of the creation of this portrait. Other portraits, created in life, depict her with a fuller face and dressed alla Spagnola. It should be noted that despite the regal implications, in life Eleonora did not frequently wear black and gold (typical regal Spanish colors), and inventories of her wardrobe from the period indicate she did not own any gold and black attire such as the gown she is depicted in the portrait (Cox-Rearick, 2009). This fact further facilitates the idea that Bronzino was tasked with communicating a regal identity for Eleonora in death that more aligned**

**with the stylings of the period and class conventions, than her own personal style choices. The extra long string of pearls, a favorite gem stone of hers, she wears in the portrait speaks to the period characteristics for noblewomen associated with pearls (beauty, purity, and chastity), which when paired with the very conservative style of her high necked partlet (not a style she would have worn in life) this concept of a pure, pious, Spanish-Italian Catholic woman is clear (San Holian, 2008). A similar portrait by Alessandro Allori from 1572 (Cox-Rearick, 2009, p. 60), ten years after her death, depicts her in similar garments that more align with northern/ Elizabethan style conventions in not her Spagnola-Italian preferences. Cox-Rearick (2013) justifies this court dress identity shift after Eleonora's death to political alliances with individuals leaning towards Austro-Hispanic dress influences. By the time of the painting of this portrait Francesco di Medici had remarried a Habsburg princess, Giovanna d' Austria, who brought that Austro-Hispanic styling to court (Cox-Rearick, 2013).**

  - **a.** *Portrait of Bianca Capello,* **1584-87: This portrait created several years after the one under analysis showcases Bianca in a similar yet more complex style of dress, her face significantly more full in this portrait than the one under analysis. This could speak to the portrait under analysis depicting a younger Bianca.**
  - **b.** *Portrait of Duchess Bianca Capello de Medici with Her Son***, c. 1580-1614: This portrait shows Bianca appearing physically similar to the other Allori depictions, however she is more youthful in the depiction under analysis. Furthermore, this portrait shows more status and identity symbolism than the torso portrait, indicating again that the portrait under analysis is likely a less formal portrait than this one. The inclusion of her son in this portrait really speaks to the status Bianca is trying to convey as depending on the actual date of this portrait, her son had been named as heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.**
  - **c.** *Portrait of Bianca Cappello,c. 1580:* **This portrait is similar to the c. 1584-87 portrait.

## *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - b. **Bianca's youthful appearance and lack of Medici symbolism within the portrait stands out. This is likely an indicator that this portrait is prior to her marrying into the Medici family.**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This work is consistent with my research question, and informs on Bianca Cappello's dress identity during multiple periods in her life.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **The work showcases Allori's earlier lack of refined skill, while also attempting to maintain Humanist artistic traditions.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **See Reflection question #25.**
- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - a. **Bianca's affair with Francesco de' Medici likely began sometime after her 1563 elopement and pregnancy with Piero Buonaventuri. Bianca remained Francesco's mistress even upon his marriage to Giovanna of Austria and his ascension to becoming the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1576, Bianca gave birth to Francesco's first son Antonio. This portrait is distinctly different**

**from later portraits of Bianca after she becomes Grand Duchess in 1579 (Musacchio, 2019). With this knowledge it is likely that this portrait of Bianca was created between 1563 and 1579. The theory that this is a younger Bianca prior to her marriage to Francesco is further justified in Bianca's lack of extravagance (i.e. lace, jewelry, fine textiles, etc), in addition to the not as obvious alla Spagnola dress conventions. Before Bianca became Grand Duchess she would have experienced less pressure to comply with dress standards of other ruling monarchs and aristocrats, as evidenced by the garments and styles seen in this portrait.**

On Bianca's head she wears pearl drop earrings, and has what is likely pearl hairpins placed in her hair, the largest at the middle part of the front of her head. Bianca also has a black and gold lace veil attached to the back of her hair that flows past her shoulders in length.**
- 30. Are there visible signifiers of rank or status such as jewelry, metals, swords, or armor?

- 33. Is this a realistic or abstracted image?
  - a. **The image appears to be realistic.**
- 34. Are any parts of the image unfinished or indistinguishable?
  - a. **All elements of the composition are distinguishable.**
- 35. Does the artwork fit within a certain stylistic period in art history? If so, is it consistent with the dominant characteristics of that style?
  - a. **The painting fits within the late Renaissance and late Mannerist movement. Allori has captured the realism of her body and the objects and garments that surroung her. The artwork fits within the late Renaissance artistic style in which humanism is style a characteristic, however early elements of Baroque begin to appear in this work. The heightened detail in anatomical accuracy and dress details showcases the Humanist characteristics of Renaissance art. The fuller and highlighted face is more characteristic of later Renaissance/ early Baroque art.**
- 36. What is the sense of space in the work? Is there foreground/middle ground/ background? How are they linked? Is the sense of space literal or indeterminate?
  - a. **Allori creates a more subtle differential between mid ground and foreground than mid-ground and background. The background is clearly defined**

I believe this size composition was intentional to convey the size and power in which Bianca held during this period. Bianca being depicted at this size makes her appear as an imposing, beautiful, figure.**
- 39. How was space used to contain the representation of the body? Think of the lines within the artwork and how they echo or contain space around the bodies.
  - **a. Bianca's body and garments are depicted as taking up the majority of the composition. The voluminous nature and space taking subject are similar to the styles of portraiture seen in Baroque works. The entire bottom of the composition is made up of Bianca's gown and sleeves, with the chair arm peeking out from underneath, with her body taking up less and less space as you move up the composition. Bianca's body effectively acts as a triangle within the rectangular composition and guides the eye to her face, the point of the triangle and focal point.**
- 40. Does the use of color bring attention t certain forms, create movement, or generate a mood?
  - a. **The use of white draws the eyes to Bianca's face and her neck where she showcases status indicators such as the needle lace ruff and her pearl jewelry. Furthermore, the regal gold, white, and silver (?) of her outer and under gown and bodice aid in showcasing the complex textiles and style of her gown. The delicate white pearls embroidered throughout her gown aid in moving the eye initially from the pearl earrings and necklace that Bianca is wearing, to the white ruff, to the white pearls dispersed throughout. The prominence of the dark rich colors on her bodice/ gown are intended to hint at Bianca's royal status and the detail in the brocade textiles are likely to inspire awe. Additionally, the red/pink carnation placed at Bianca's neckline further draws the eyes to the v-shape of his neckline and her hand touching the pearls at the edge of the neckline.**

## *Reflection*

- 1. What does the artist emphasize visually? What does this signify?
  - d. **The artist visually emphasized Bianca's face and her elaborate dress. This is likely in an attempt to articulate her status and identity.**
- 2. How does the artist emphasize this aspect? Through scale, line, color, etc?
  - a. **The artist emphasized these elements using, line, color and scale. See Observation questions #39 and #40.**
- 3. Is there an underlying rhythm, pattern, or geometric structure to the composition?

- a. **See Observation question #39. There are also an abundance of circular structures within the composition. Most obviously the circular nature of the pearls mimic themselves in the rounded shape of Bianca's face/head.**
- 4. Is there a sense of balance or has the artist deliberately chosen to destabilize the composition?
  - a. **There is a slight color imbalance, which was purposely utilized to place emphasis on Bianca's face. Other elements within the composition appear fairly balanced with a fairly symmetrical depiction of her gown. However, the positioning of Bianca in a ¾ pose creates an inherent imbalance within the portrait composition, causing the portrait to appear content heavy on the right side of the canvas.**
- 5. Does the composition seem unified? Do the elements appear integrated or separate from each other?
  - a. **The portrait appears to be overall very unified, in color, scale, and consistent use of line. The balanced use of color drastically aids in the integration of the numerous elements of Bianca's depiction.**
- 6. What do you think the artist is trying to express in this artwork? How is this achieved visually?
  - a. **I believe the artist is trying to convey Bianca's royal status, her status as the Grand Duke's wife, and her identity as a aristocratic lady. This idea would be necessary to convey in Florence and the Florentine court a Bianca had her status elevated from mistress to wife very soon after the Grand Duke's wife had died.**
- 7. Does the choice of medium impact the work in a material way?
  - a. **The choice of medium does not impact the work, other than to remain consistent with Renaissance portraiture conventions.**
- 8. How has the artist used rest to define the profession, class, status, racial, or gender identity of the sitter?
  - a. **Bianca rests leisurely against the wooden chair arm in this composition. She is not performing any task or activity in this portrait, hinting at her leisurely lifestyle, and ability to sit for a portrait for hours on end. This leisurely lifestyle speaks to her membership to the aristocracy/ royal family, her position as a woman born into wealth.**
- 9. Is the dress of each sitter consistent with his or her gender, age, class, and occupation?
  - a. **The dress Bianca is depicted in is consistent with her class, gender, and overall identity.**
- 10. Are the garments stylistically consistent with the period in which the artwork was created?
  - a. **The garments depicted in this painting are consistent with the period and region.**
- 11. Do the garments depicted have stylistic, religious, artistic, or iconic references?
  - a. **The lace collar and style of bodice worn by Bianca indicated a stylistic shift in Italian dress during the period. This shift is a result of a shift in political and social influence from Spain and England during this period. However the slashing on her sleeve are historically an Italian stylistic reference.**

- 12. How does the clothing shape and fashion the body? Does it disguise, conceal, or reveal the body?
  - a. **The clothing Bianca is wearing very clearly conceals almost her entire body with the exception of her neck and part of the collar bone. Her bodice appears to shape her natural waist into a deep v shape, a popular style in Spanish and alla Spagnola styles of the period. The padded shoulders create and emphasis and shape the shoulders in a way to make them appear broader.**
- 13. Has the artist taken liberties with the visual representation of the sitter? Is the body elongated or distorted in anyway? If so, consider whether this distortion reflects norms of beauty for the period.
  - a. **The artist does not appear to have taken visual liberties with the depiction of Bianca in this painting.**
- 14. What was the impetus to examine this artwork(s)? Were you interested in the artist, elements of the dress, or the person(s) in the image?
  - a. **This painting was examined to gather insight into Bianca Cappello's dress identity as the Grand Duchess of Tuscany.**
- 15. Do you have an emotive reaction to the image? Does it appeal to you or repulse you? Does it remind you of something else?
  - a. **I do not have any emotive reaction to this image.**
- 16. Do your personal reactions indicate that cultural beliefs have shifted?
  - a. **My personal reactions have no connection with a shift in cultural beliefs.**
- 17. Can you identify a personal connection to this work or a bias that should be acknowledge in your research?
  - a. **I cannot identify a personal connection with this painting.**
- 18. Is this a single work or part of a series? If it is a series, how many are in the series?
  - a. **This work appears to be a single work.**
- 19. Has the artist created other works that are not part of a series but are otherwise similar to this work? If so, list them here and consider what might be learned from this comparison.
  - **a.** *Portrait of Bianca Capello,* **1584-87: This portrait created several years after the one under analysis showcases Bianca in a very similar style of dress, her face similar in shape with minor detail changes between the two portraits. This could speak to a specific identity that Bianca wanted consistently portrayed in her portraits. This concept is further proven as both portraits utilize a similar color scheme of red, gold, and white.**
  - **b.** *Portrait of Duchess Bianca Capello de Medici with Her Son***, c. 1580-1614: This portrait also shows Bianca appearing physically similar to the other Allori depictions, which indicates that this is likely a realistic depiction of her at this age. Furthermore, this portrait shows more status and identity symbolism than the torso portrait, indicating again that the portrait under analysis is likely a less formal portrait than this one. The inclusion of her son in this portrait really speaks to the status Bianca is trying to convey as depending on the actual date of this portrait, her son had been named as heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.**

## *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?
  - c. **The lack of symbolism stands out to me. In a court portrait such as this one from this period it would be typical to find an abundance of such symbolism. For example, the portrait lacks a number of Medici iconography outside of pearls.**
- 2. Does this work provoke n emotive reaction, connect to your background or interests, or otherwise inspire a research question or questions?
  - a. **This work aligns with my thesis research question as it informs Bianca's dress identity during this specific period of her life within the Medici family.**
- 3. What does the work have to say about the artist and the visual traditions of the period in which it was made?
  - a. **This work only slightly speaks to Allori's renown in the late Mannerist movement in Renaissance art. This painting lacks the detail and refinement of other Mannerist art, which could possibly indicate that Allori wasn't "putting his all" into this portrait.**
- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **The dress featured in this painting shows the spread of alla Spagnola style and English style to Italy and Italian courts during this period. Despite the Florentine style dominating Florence throughout the Italian Renaissance and the early 16th century, this painting shows an end of that.**

- 5. Consider the artwork and the fashions depicted therein in relation to a conceptual framework or lens of interpretation that is linked to your research focus. Identify that framework here and briefly consider one or more key texts related to that theory. The suggested frames of references include, but not limited to: status, modernity, ideals of beauty, identity, including gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, politics of representation, and globalization.
  - a. **Bianca is depicted in this painting at an age that would have been consistent with her actual age at the time, which would have been between 36 and 39. Similar to the later Allori portrait of Bianca, this portrait features the inclusion of a red flower, likely a carnation, tucked into her bodice neckline. The inclusion of the red carnation tucked into her bodice is an example of overt period symbolism, as during the Renaissance the inclusion of carnations in northern Italian Renaissance art referred to love and marriage (Meagher, 2007). Considering historic records of Francesco and Bianca's love marriage, this would be a consistent symbolism to include in portrait. This is specifically relevant as the date of this portrait places it just a year after their 1579 marriage. It has been noted that historically speaking the Florentine people were not a fan of their marriage as they viewed Bianca brought little to benefit Florence (Musacchio, 2019). As a result, the public dislike for the duke marrying his former mistress only a year after his wife's death would incentivize Bianca to cultivate a very specific public identity and persona to gather respect. The ornate gown and jewelry in which she is depicted and the regal manner, consistent with other women of the period of similar social status, in which she holds herself was likely to convince viewers of the royal portrait that she was more than the duke's mistress now, but rather his wife and the Grand Duchess of Tuscany. This paired with the carnation and her visible wedding ring convey not only her new elevated status as Grand Duchess but her true and genuine love for Francesco.**

## *Interpretation*

- 1. Review the material that you have recorded in your observation and reflection on artwork. What stands out for you?

- 4. What does the depiction of fashion in the artwork say about the culture of the period?
  - a. **The dress featured in this painting shows the spread of alla Spagnola style and English style to Italy and Italian courts during this period.

a. **Bianca Cappello was born in Venice in 1548 to a noble family. Her affair with Francesco de' Medici likely began sometime after her 1563 elopement and pregnancy with Piero Buonaventuri. Bianca remained Francesco's mistress even upon his marriage to Giovanna of Austria and his ascension to becoming the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1576, Bianca gave birth to Francesco's first son Antonio. Following the murder and sudden death in childbirth of their respective spouses in 1578, the two lovers wed. Although Bianca was unable to provide Francesco any more children following their marriage, they are said to have lived a happy and loving marriage. This painting was likely created before their sudden deaths in 1587 or after as a commemorative painting (Musacchio, 2019). Bianca is depicted in this painting as a young woman, despite her actually being between 37 and 39 at the time of the painting, possibly a hint at the way she looked when the she first met Francesco in her 20s. The white veil and updo hair indicate her status as a married woman, along with the abundance of pearls signifying purity (rather ironic) and wealth. Her choice to adopt foreign styles of dress can possibly attributed to her Venetian upbringing, and the fact that throughout her affair and marriage to Francesco the people of Florence never grew to like her. Similarly, her choice** 

**in dress, specifically the ruff could be a decision made to emulate such popular female rulers of the time such as Queen Elizabeth I (Tortora & Marcketti, ). While her husband and familial life were notably happy, it is possible that through her dress identity and public persona such as the one depicted in this painting she aimed to garner the respect and support of the people she ruled.**
